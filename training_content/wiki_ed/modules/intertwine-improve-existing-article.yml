name: 'Intertwine: Evaluate & improve a Wikipedia article with your peers'
id: 19
description: |
  In this module, you will “get your hands dirty” evaluating a Wikipedia article together with peer editors.

  When you finish, you should:

  * Understand what makes a good Wikipedia article (e.g., structure, neutral point of view, references).
  * Get practice of improving a Wikipedia article
  * Communicate your thoughts with the broader Wikipedia community.
  * Meet other Wikipedia editors and learn from each other's experiences.

  *Note that this training module will introduce Intertwine and help you sign up for a discussion session. You will participate in the discussion later at the time you’ve scheduled.*
