name: 'Intertwine: Evaluate & Improve a Wikipedia Article with Your Peers'
id: 19
description: |
  In this module, you will “get your hands dirty” evaluating a Wikipedia article together with peer editors.

  When you finish, you should:

  * Learn about / review what makes a good Wikipedia article (e.g., structure, neutral point of view, references).
  * Get practice of improving a Wikipedia article
  * Communicate your thoughts with the broader Wikipedia community.
  * Know several Wikipedia editors and learn from each other's experiences.

  *Note that the training module itself will introduce Intertwine and help you sign up for a discussion session. You will participate in the discussion and achieve the above learning goals at a later time you picked.*
