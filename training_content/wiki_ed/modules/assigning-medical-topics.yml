description: |
  This module discusses best practices and special considerations for
  assignments that involve editing topics related to medicine and human health,
  including psychology topics. Wikipedia has special sourcing rules for health
  content, and it's important to design assignments with these rules in mind, if
  students will be working on anything health-related.
