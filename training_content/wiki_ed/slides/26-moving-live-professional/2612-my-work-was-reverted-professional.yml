title: My work was reverted!
content: |
  Stay calm! If your work is reverted by another editor, it is your
  responsibility to open a dialogue with that editor about why the work
  was removed.

  Do not add anything back until you understand why it was removed and how
  you can fix it. If you *do* add reverted work back without going through
  these steps, it will be seen as an edit war and your account could be
  blocked.

  You can always reach out to your Wikipedia Expert for advice.
