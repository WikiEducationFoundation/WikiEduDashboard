title: Moving a new article out of the sandbox
content: |
  With a good title in mind, you're probably ready to start moving.

  1.  Do a search of Wikipedia to make sure that there's no article on
      Wikipedia covering the topic you've worked on. (It's possible,
      though uncommon, for someone else to create an article with the same
      name while you were drafting yours.) If there is an existing
      article, follow the steps in the earlier slides to merge your
      content into the article.
  2.  Go to your draft sandbox.
  3.  Do a final review of your article, following the checklist found on
      page 15 of the [Editing
      Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_%28Wiki_Education_Foundation%29_%282017%29.pdf#page=15)
      brochure.
  4.  On the draft sandbox page where your article is, look to the upper-right.
      To the left of your search bar is a tab called “Tools.” Click it, and
      then click “Move.”

  A new page will appear.
