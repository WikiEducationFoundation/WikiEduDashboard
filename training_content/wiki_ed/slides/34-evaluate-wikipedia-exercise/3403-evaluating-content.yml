  * Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything
  that distracted you?
  * Is any information out of date? Is anything missing that could be added?
  * Can you identify any notable equity gaps? Does the article underrepresent
  or misrepresent historically marginalized populations?
  * What else could be improved?
