  Start by choosing an article on Wikipedia related to your course to read and
  evaluate.

  To find one, you can:
  * look through the [Academic disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_disciplines)
  category,
  * look through these [C-class articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:C-Class_articles), or
  * search within a [WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory)
  that is of interest to you. (A WikiProject is a group of Wikipedians that
  forms around a particular topic).
