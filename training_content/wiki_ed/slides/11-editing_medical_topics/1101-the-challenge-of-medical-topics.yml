title: The challenges of editing topics related to human health
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia has its own rules for editing topics related to medicine and psychology.
  That's because Wikipedia is one of the leading websites people turn to for health
  information, more so than websites from the National Institute of Health,
  World Health Organization, or WebMD.

  Poor information about health topics can have real-world consequences for
  readers who don't always bring the amount of skepticism they should to
  Wikipedia's health information.

  That's why MEDRS exists. MEDRS is short for "Medical Reliable Sources," and
  it's the set of guidelines for identifying reliable sources in medicine and
  psychology. These standards can make it challenging for student editors to
  contribute to these topics.

  This orientation will give you an overview of those requirements, which are
  available in detail by typing the Wikipedia shortcut `WP:MEDRS`
  into Wikipedia's search bar.
