title: "When doesn't MEDRS apply?"
summary:
content: |
  It's important to be careful, but don't panic. Not *every* statement in a
  biomedical article requires you follow the MEDRS guidelines.

  MEDRS does *not* apply to statements that *don't* touch on human biomedical
  topics, *even if the statement appears within a biomedical-related article*.

  Oftentimes, this level of sourcing would be inappropriate or impossible, and
  could actually stand in the way of writing a strong article.

  For example:
  * A sentence in the "culture" section of the "Black Death" article describing
  its impact on 14th century religious fervor in Europe
  * A "history" section within the "Opium" article, describing its use in ancient
  times
  * A "popular culture" section mentioning that the fictional protagonist of the
  spy-thriller series Homeland was diagnosed with bipolar disorder

  Though you should always use the best-quality sources you can find, these
  types of statements do *not* require MEDRS.
