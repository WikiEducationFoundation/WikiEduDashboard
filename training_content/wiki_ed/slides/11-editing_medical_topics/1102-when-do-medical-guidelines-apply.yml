title: When do these MEDRS guidelines apply?
summary:
content: |
  "MEDRS" guidelines apply specifically to "biomedical content." That means
  they apply to any statement related to the medical or mental health of human
  beings on Wikipedia, wherever they appear.

  Ask yourself: Could someone conceivably use the statements to draw conclusions
  about their own physical or mental health? If so, use MEDRS.

  This includes:
  * Statements about medicine, diseases, conditions, or diagnoses on Wikipedia
  * Individual statements about human health, even within non-medical articles
  * Content about human biochemistry or medical research in animals (if it
  is relevant to human health)

  Note that MEDRS applies to *statements*, not just articles. So, if you're
  writing about a plant in a botany article and decide to describe its medical
  uses, those statements would require MEDRS sourcing. The opposite is also
  true, as we'll see in the next slide.
