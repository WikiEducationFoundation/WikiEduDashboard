title: No original research
summary:
content: |
  "Original research" on Wikipedia means drawing any conclusions that are not
  specifically mentioned within a cited source. This is true of all articles,
  but is particularly crucial for medical content.

  Never use material from different sources to suggest a conclusion that isnâ€™t
  explicitly stated by those sources. If one reliable source says A, and another
  says B, resist the temptation to connect A and B in your article.

  Pay close attention to your paraphrasing of medical information, and make sure
  that your content is accurate without citing the original text too closely.
