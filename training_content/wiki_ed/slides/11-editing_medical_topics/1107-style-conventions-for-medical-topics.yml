title: Style conventions for medical topics
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia has a detailed
  [Manual of Style for medicine-related articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles).

  Two elements in particular can help avoid common problems:
  * **PMID references:** for references to sources in PubMed, be sure to include
  the PMIDs within your citation. That way, other editors can easily track down
  and verify your sources. If other editors can't find your source, they may
  remove your work. You can find the PMID# at the bottom of an article's abstract.
  * **Recommended article sections:** common medicine-related topics have
  a [recommended outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDSECTIONS)
  you should follow as starting points when structuring an article.
