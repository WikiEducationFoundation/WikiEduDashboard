title: "Keep a blog"
content: |
  Keeping track of your Wikipedia assignment in a blog is a great way to reflect
  on the experience as you progress through the different phases of this project.
  Each week you can think about what you've learned and how it fits into the
  larger context of your Wikipedia editing experience and your particular course.

  We recommend that you keep a weekly blog so you can document your thoughts and
  insights as they arise during the different phases of this assignment.

  Note: Wiki Education does not provide a platform for your blog.
