title: "Best practices for building a new article"
content: |
  To create a new Wikipedia article rather than improve an existing one,
  you'll need to prepare an initial version on a **Sandbox Draft** page (linked from "My Articles" on your Dashboard course page).
  For this first version, write a two-paragraph summary
  of the topic, and cite at least three [good sources](/training/students/sources/examples-of-reliable-sources).
  When you are ready to make it live, [follow these instructions](/training/students/moving-to-mainspace/moving-a-new-article-out-of-the-sandbox-v2).

  You only need to clearly define the topic and establish its significance before
  moving it live — no need to write more! Once the article is live,
  other editors can identify major problems, and you want to have time to
  correct them before your course ends so that your work sticks around on Wikipedia.

  Once you've moved it live, you'll continue expanding and improving it
  just as you would an already-existing article.
