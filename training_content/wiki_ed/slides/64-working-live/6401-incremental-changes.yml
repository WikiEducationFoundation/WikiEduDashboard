  The best way to edit Wikipedia articles is to make one small change at a time.

  Once you've collected and reviewed your reliable sources, studied the article you're going to edit, and planned the changes you want to make, it's time to make those changes to the live article!

  Here's what to do:
  * Navigate to your Wikipedia article and click the [edit] button for the first section you want to edit.
  * Make some changes, then use the "Cite" button to add the source you're using.
  * Click "Publish changes", enter a brief edit summary to describe your changes, then save them by clicking "Publish changes" in the popup.
  * That's it!
