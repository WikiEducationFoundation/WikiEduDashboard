  Here's some additional advice for if you're working in a group:

  * On Wikipedia — unlike Google Docs and some other collaborative editing
  tools — edits made by others do not show up automatically while you are
  in edit mode. When you click "Publish" on a new edit, if other edits happened
  in the meantime, Wikipedia will attempt to incorpate the new changes into the
  latest version. If the software can't do so, the result is an "edit conflict";
  your edit will not be saved unless you manually re-incorporate it into the latest version.
  It is safe to work simulaneously with others if each group member is editing a separate
  section, but if you are collaborating on the same section of text, make sure you've refreshed
  to the latest edit before you make a new change.

  * If you've collaboratively prepared an update with a group, and you want to publish in a single
  edit, you can use the Edit Summary to credit the other editors.
