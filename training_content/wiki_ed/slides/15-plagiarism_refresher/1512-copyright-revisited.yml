  Wikipedia is a free resource that anyone can use. But don't assume that you
  can upload anything to Wikipedia.

  In fact, because anyone can copy and re-use Wikipedia's content, it's crucial
  that you never upload any material that isn't explicitly allowed to be shared.

  We already discussed copying and pasting material from an author, even with a
  citation, as being a copyright violation.

  The same goes for using song lyrics, quotations, or copyrighted educational
  materials.
