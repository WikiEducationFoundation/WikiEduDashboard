title: Plagiarism of cited sources
summary:
content: |
  Plagiarism can also mean passing off someone else's words as your own.

  Even with proper credit, using full passages of another author's work is a
  copyright violation.

  Except for very brief quotations that are essential to understanding a topic,
  copying content from copyrighted sources onto Wikipedia is against policy.

  Instead, you should *paraphrase* the ideas and concepts you want to share on
  Wikipedia: present the information, phrased in a new way.
