        Because anyone can copy and re-use Wikipedia's content, the more
        information you copy directly from books, magazines, and other sources of
        knowledge, the better the world becomes.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Because people can copy and re-use Wikipedia's content, it's
        important that everything on Wikipedia is original writing drawn from
        reliable sources without violating copyright.
