title: A note on plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  Plagiarism is a scary word, and it's important to remember that it isn't a
  value judgment on you as a person.

  You might be thinking, "I'm a good person, I would never plagiarize!"

  But as you will see, many people plagiarize by mistake, or simply don't know
  all the rules.

  As you go through this orientation, remember that this is guidance to help you
  avoid falling into problems with the way you use the information in your
  sources.

  It's not a statement about your integrity as a student!
