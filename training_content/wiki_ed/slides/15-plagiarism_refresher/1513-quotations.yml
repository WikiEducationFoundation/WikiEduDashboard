title: Quotations

  By now, you may have noticed many ways that writing for Wikipedia is different from
  writing a traditional academic paper. The use of quotations is another difference.

  In general, quotations on Wikipedia aren't very helpful. Whenever you're
  tempted to quote an author, ask yourself: What is my argument for quoting this
  directly, instead of paraphrasing it?

  In some cases, such as writing about a famous speech, political theory, or
  other article that references a specific text, you may find compelling reasons
  to introduce a direct quotation.

  If you do, be sure to cite it as you would any other source, and to include it
  within quotation marks.
