title: Unattributed plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  Let's look at unattributed plagiarism first. This is generally the first thing
  that comes to mind with the word "plagiarism."

  You don't want to present another writer's ideas as your own. That takes
  credit away from the author.

  It also means presenting a statement without a cited source, and nothing on
  Wikipedia should be posted without a reference to a reliable source.
