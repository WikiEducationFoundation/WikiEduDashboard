title: Close paraphrasing
summary:
content: |
  When you find good information for a Wikipedia article, you'll want to put it
  into your own words.

  Make sure the words, and structure, of the information you share are
  *substantially* different from the source it came from.

  Close paraphrasing is when the basic structure of a sentence or passage stays
  the same, even with small tweaks to the wording.

  This is bad news, whether you cite it or not.
