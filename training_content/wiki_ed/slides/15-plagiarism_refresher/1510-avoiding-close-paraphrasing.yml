title: Avoiding close paraphrasing
summary:
content: |
  Here are some tips to avoid close paraphrasing:

  * Find a few different sources, and take notes in your own writing. Write
  notes like you were explaining the idea to a friend, rather than just
  transcribing the source.
  * Don't write your article with your original sources open in front of you.
  Take careful notes, then reference your notes as you write your article. When
  you're done, re-read the article. This time, make frequent references to your
  original sources to verify that they're not too similar.
  * Start by taking notes of key concepts, not phrases, from your sources,
  noting where each came from.

  In the next slide, we'll let you see if you can find some forms of close
  paraphrasing.
