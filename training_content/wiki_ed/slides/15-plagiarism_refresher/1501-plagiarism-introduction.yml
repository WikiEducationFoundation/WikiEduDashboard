  Wikipedia is a free resource for everyone. Because everyone can use it, copy
  it, and re-use it freely, it can't contain restricted, copyrighted material.

  You probably know that copying-and-pasting from a book or website and claiming
  it as your own work is plagiarism. That's the most egregious example, but it
  isn't the only one.

  The stakes of plagiarism are high. It could be a violation of your student
  code of conduct, and could get you banned from editing Wikipedia.

  But don't panic. In this training, we'll go over forms of plagiarism to make
  sure you don't stumble!
