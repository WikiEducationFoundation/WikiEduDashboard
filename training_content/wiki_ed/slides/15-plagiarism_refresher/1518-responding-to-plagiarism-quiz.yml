    Imagine you've been editing your article, and someone flags a recent
    contribution as being plagiarized. Based on your understanding from this and
    other online trainings about Wikipedia, what should you do?

        Assume the author has a vendetta. After all, you know you're an honest
        person â€” you would never plagiarize! Ignore the Wikipedian, and add the
        content back.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Remember, plagiarism isn't a statement about you as a person,
        it's an assessment of the information you've shared. You might have
        plagiarized on accident. In any case, don't just put it back, as that
        could be construed as "edit-warring," and you could be banned from
        editing.

        Review your contribution, and compare it to the original source. See
        what's similar, and how you can rephrase it to use less of the original
        structure or words. Then, add it back in.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! Wikipedians who flag plagiarism will appreciate your efforts in
        correcting it, and perhaps give you feedback on the revision.

        Assume the source is copyrighted and can't be used on Wikipedia. Find a
        different source that isn't copyrighted.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Much of the material you'll use for a Wikipedia article is
        likely to have a copyright applied. You can use the same source, but
        revisit your contribution and see if you can rework it to be less
        similar to the original source.

        Delete your Wikipedia account, because you've been blacklisted as a
        plagiarist.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Importantly, your Wikipedia account can't be easily deleted.
        But you don't have to flee, or be embarrassed. Instead, look at your
        contribution, look at the source material, and try to rework it to be
        less similar. You can work with other Wikipedia editors to solve the
        problem.
