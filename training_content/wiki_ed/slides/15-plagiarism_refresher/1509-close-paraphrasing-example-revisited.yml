title: Examples of close paraphrasing

  Here's an example of "close paraphrasing."

  **Original text:**
  > Because the weather forecast called for rain, the league decided to switch
  the location of the game to an indoor facility.

  **Close paraphrased text, not acceptable on Wikipedia:**
  > The league switched the gameâ€™s location to an indoor facility due to a
  weather forecast calling for rain.

  **Acceptable text:**
  > The league moved the match indoors to avoid forecasted rain.

  In the close paraphrased text, a few words have been changed, and the sentence
  structure was flipped. That doesn't make it distinct enough from the original.

  The second text says the same thing but in an almost entirely unique way.
