  Continue to expand your bibliography for your chosen topic and post that
  bibliography to the Talk page of the article you'll be working on, and
  on the bibliography page in your sandbox. To find your bibliography page
  go to the My Articles section, and click on the Bibliography link underneath
  the article you are working on.

  Make sure to check in on the Talk page to see if anyone has advice on your
  bibliography. Adding the article to your Watchlist by clicking the star next to
  "View history" will help you keep track. If you've added your email to your
  account (which is a *really* good idea), you'll get notifications if something
  on the page changes.
