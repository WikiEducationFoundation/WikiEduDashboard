  Once you've compiled a bibliography for your chosen article, it's now time to write up a brief plan for your contribution.
  This is not a draft. It's a space where you can propose your plan for how you'll improve your selected article.

  Think about how the sources you've collected will add new information to the article.

  Discuss any other changes you plan on making to the article, including deleting information, restructuring, and any other ways you plan on alterting the article.

  You may wish to use simple bullet points for this outline.
