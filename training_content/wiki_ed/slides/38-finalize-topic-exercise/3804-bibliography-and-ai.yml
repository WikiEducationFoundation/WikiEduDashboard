  Generative AI-powered chatbots (like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude) can sometimes
  be useful to help search for sources. If you do use them, however, keep in mind:

  * Make sure you read the source yourself and pull facts from it, rather than
  relying on the chatbot's summary of the article. Frequently, chatbots will
  falsely attribute claims to sources. Adding unchecked information damages
  Wikipedia, so please don't add any information you haven't personally verified
  is in the source you've cited it to.
  * AI tools will occasionally "hallucinate" sources that don't exist; if you're
  reading them thoroughly, you won't get caught by this, so make sure you find
  and read every source a chatbot suggests citing!
  * AI chatbots may point to sources that don’t fit Wikipedia’s definition of
  reliable sources, even if you prompt them not to. Review the
  "[Evaluating articles and sources](/training/students/evaluating-articles)"
  training to remind yourself of Wikipedia's sourcing rules, and use those
  to evaluate anything you plan to cite.
