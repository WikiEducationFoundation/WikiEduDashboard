  Now that you are thinking about the problem of content gaps, consider some additional questions:

  * Wikipedians often talk about "content gaps." What do you think a content gap is,
  and what are some possible ways to identify them?
  * What are some reasons that a content gap might arise? What are some of
  the consequences of content gaps?
  * What are some ways to remedy them?
  * What is the relationship between content gaps and Wikipedia’s “notability” and
  “neutrality” policies? When do these issues conflict? When do they complement one
  another? Explain.
  * If "anyone" can edit Wikipedia, does it matter who "does" edit Wikipedia?
  * What does it mean to be "unbiased" on Wikipedia? How is that different, or similar,
  to your own definition of "bias"? In your discussion be sure to address how bias and
  notability affect each other.
  * What is the relationship between Wikipedia's sourcing policies and content gaps?
