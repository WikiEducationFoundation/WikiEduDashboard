  Now that you're thinking about what makes a "good" Wikipedia article, consider some additional questions.

  * Wikipedians often talk about "content gaps." What do you think a content gap is, and what are some possible ways to identify them?
  * What are some reasons a content gap might arise? What are some ways to remedy them?
  * Does it matter who writes Wikipedia?
  * What does it mean to be "unbiased" on Wikipedia? How is that different, or similar, to your own definition of "bias"?
