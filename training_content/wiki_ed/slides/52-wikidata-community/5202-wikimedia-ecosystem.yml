title: "The Wikimedia ecosystem"

  First, let's define how Wikidata fits into the Wikimedia ecosystem.

  **Wikidata** is the linked data project for Wikimedia projects. **The Wikimedia
  Foundation** is the organization that runs all Wikimedia projects. The Wikimedia
  Foundation has chapters all over the world, including Germany. **Wikimedia
  Deutschland** is the non-profit organization that built and maintains Wikidata.

  There are other Wikimedia projects (sister projects) that you may come across
  as you edit, such as **Wikipedia**, **Wiktionary**, or **Wikibooks**, among others.

  Since Wikidata items can use media you may also hear about **Wikimedia Commons**,
  which is the media repository that all Wikimedia projects use. It's similar to
  Wikidata in that all other Wikimedia projects pull images and other media from this central
  repository. It is different from Wikidata in that Commons is exclusively for media.

  **Wiki Education** (that's us!) is a non-profit organization, separate from
  Wikimedia, that teaches individuals how to contribute to Wikimedia projects.
  We envision a broader and more diverse Wikimedia ecosystem that welcomes
  public and academic participation, in which students, scholars, and institutions
  of higher learning are actively engaged in investigating and representing knowledge.
