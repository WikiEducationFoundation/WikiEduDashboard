  If you want to leave a message on Project chat for the community, follow these steps.

  * Go to the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat">Project chat</a> page.
  * Click the blue "Start a new discussion" button.
  * Write a message and make sure to include a title in the title line.
  * Sign the message by writing <code>~~~~</code> at the end of your message.
  * Click Show preview underneath your message to make sure your message has been
  written correctly, you will see that your username has appeared where the <code>~~~~</code>
  was added.
  * Click "Save page" to post the message.
  * Users will either reply to your message on the Project chat page or on your
  userpage which you can access by clicking "Talk" at the top of the screen next
  to your username. Please note pages become archived after a short while to make
  room for new messages, to access old messages go to the Archive index.

  The community is an excellent resource for feedback, recommendations, and
  troubleshooting. New data is an exciting thing for an editor, so it's the best
  policy to let the community know.
