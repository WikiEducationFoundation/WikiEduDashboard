summary:
content: |
  You can ask any Wikidata-related question you like on Project chat. Keep in
  mind that it's a community-wide forum, so if you have a specific question, you
  may want to look to a WikiProject first. On project chat you can ask questions
  about how to disambiguate items correctly, clarify property usage questions, or
  ask about how to best reference a statement.

  Beyond asking questions, reading Project chat is a great way to understand how
  Wikidata works. Editors discuss ways of improving processes on Wikidata, new
  editors ask how properties work, and debates about best practices play out here.
