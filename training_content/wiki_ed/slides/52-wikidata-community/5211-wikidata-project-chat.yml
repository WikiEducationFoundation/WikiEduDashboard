  The central place for discussions on Wikidata is the Project chat. If you have
  something to ask that doesn't fit well into a discussion page or a WikiProject,
  Project chat is probably the place to get started.

  Perusing project chat is also useful to get a sense of the sorts of things the
  community is up to.
