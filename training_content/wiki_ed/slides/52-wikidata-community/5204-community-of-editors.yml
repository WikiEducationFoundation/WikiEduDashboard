title: "A community of editors"
summary:
content: |
  The Wikidata **community** consists of the group of **editors** who participate
  in the project. Anyone who makes an edit to a Wikimedia project is an editor
  â€“ there's no formal editorial board in any project that approves or rejects
  additions to the project. It doesn't matter if you make one edit or one million
  edits, you're still an editor.

  While every editor is a part of the community, certain parts of the project
  are more collaborative than others. People who participate in project discussions
  have a hand in shaping policies and guidelines around best practices, building
  data models and creating properties, requesting new features, and building tools.
  It's the community that makes these projects so remarkable and successful.
