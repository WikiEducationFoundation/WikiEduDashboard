  How do you communicate with other editors? These slides will introduce you to
  some common ways to reach out to other editors.

  **User discussion pages**
  Just like items and properties, your user page has an associated discussion
  page where other editors can leave you messages. You will see a link to it,
  labeled "Discussion" on the top of each page. You can also access your talk
  page by clicking on <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyTalk">this link</a>.
  You can also leave messages for other editors by posting on their talk page.

  This image shows a few important details. First, this is a draft of a message
  on Will's discussion page. It has not been published yet. The way the message
  will look is below the Preview section. It starts with "Wikidata Training,"
  the subject for this message. Below you can see the message in the editing area.

  You may notice some characters that look like code. This is Wikicode, which
  is a markup language that Wikimedia projects use. For this course, you will not
  need to learn Wikicode *except* when using discussion pages. The first bit of
  Wikicode is there to ping Ian. The formula to ping another user is: <code>{{ping|USERNAME}}</code>
  where "ping" is the action to reach out to someone and after the pipe "|" you
  would add their username. Pinging someone causes a notification to appear in
  their notices in the upper right corner of the screen.

  The last bit of Wikicode is a signature. Always sign your posts with <code>~~~~</code> and
  it will be transformed into your signature and a date stamp automatically.

  **Other types of discussion pages**

  When you engage in a discussion on a WikiProject, you will generally use the
  talk page. When you engage in Project chat or a similar page, you will use the
  main project page, not the talk page.

  Editors will assume that you will read messages left on your user talk page
  and that you will check back to see if they replied to posts that you left on
  their talk page, on WikiProjects, or in other places like Project chat. You
  can do this by adding their page to your Watchlist (as explained on the next
  slide).
