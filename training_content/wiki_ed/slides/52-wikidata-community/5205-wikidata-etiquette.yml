title: "Etiquette"
summary:
content: |
  Wikidata is a Wikimedia project, which means you may interact with editors
  from any other Wikimedia project (Wikipedia, Commons, etc.). You should always
  interact with other editors in a civil and respectful manner, and you should
  expect to be treated in a similar manner.

  When you add to or modify an existing item, you're editing something that
  someone else created. That's the beauty of collaborative editing. But keep in
  mind that just as you can edit someone else's work, other people can edit yours.
  And you have to be OK with that.

  When you interact with other members of the Wikidata community, keep the
  following core policies in mind:

  * Respect people, and be polite even if you disagree. Always assume that people
  are acting in good faith.
  * Part of acting in good faith is speaking for yourself. The expectation on
  Wikidata is that users will use one account, used by a single person.
  * Speaking of you, you are allowed to edit information about you and people
  you know on Wikidata, but you should take care to represent information as
  accurately as possible and avoid controversial autobiographical editing.
  * Avoid personal attacks. Discuss the content, not the people.

  If someone makes a change that you disagree with, don't just change it back.
  This is considered **edit warring** and, if egregious enough, can get you
  blocked from editing.

  Be polite and constructive. We are all on the same team.

  **Note**: Wikidata is an international project. Please keep in mind that most
  people on Wikidata aren't native English speakers. Using plain English and
  being more patient with others will go a long way.
