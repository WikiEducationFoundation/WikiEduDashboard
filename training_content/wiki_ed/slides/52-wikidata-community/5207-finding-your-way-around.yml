  If you want to engage with the Wikidata community, you need to find the right
  place to have a discussion.

  While every page on Wikidata has an associated Discussion page (i.e., a
  connected page for editors to discuss and coordinate edits to a particular topic),
  they're a lot less widely used than on some projects like Wikipedia.

  <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Template:Discussion_navigation">Template:Discussion navigation</a>
  links to the best places on Wikidata to have
  discussions based on your needs. On the other hand, if you're interested in a
  specific area of knowledge, you'll want to find the relevant <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProjects">WikiProject</a>. 
  WikiProjects – dedicated discipline-based project pages – are especially
  important for discussing and building data models, and have their own training
  module.
