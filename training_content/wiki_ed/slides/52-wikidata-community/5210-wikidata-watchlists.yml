  How do you know when an item you have edited has been modified, or if other
  editors have replied to one of your posts?

  A personal Watchlist is an easy way to keep track of all the pages you're
  involved in. You can use your Watchlist to monitor article changes, conversations,
  and collaborations.

  To add any page to your “Watchlist”, make sure you're logged in. Then just
  click on the star next to the “View history” tab on any Wikidata page. When it
  turns blue, it's on your Watchlist. See your Watchlist by clicking “Watchlist”
  at the very top of your page when you're logged in.

      Click the star icon in the upper right by the search box to add something to your Watchlist.

  When you add an article to your Watchlist, it also “watches” that article's
  Discussion page. If someone responds to your article edits on the Discussion
  page, it will show up on your Watchlist.

  You can set your email preferences to receive email whenever pages on your
  Watchlist are changed by clicking the “Preferences” tab at the top of Wikidata
  and scrolling down to “email options.” Then check the box that reads “Email me
  when a page or a file on my Watchlist is changed.”
