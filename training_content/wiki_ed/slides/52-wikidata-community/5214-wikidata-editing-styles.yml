title: "Editing styles"
summary:
content: |
  There are many ways to edit Wikidata. Certain styles of editing may resonate
  more with you than others. This is great! We want to do whatever we can to
  foster those inclinations.

  Some editors specialize in **creating** new content. This can happen with individual
  items or with **batch uploading** large quantities of data.

  Others specialize in **monitoring** the creation of new content.

  Others, still, **specialize in certain content areas** and work to make related
  items more robust.

  Some editors **create tools** or write scripts that can help users in new ways.

  Others work on **new policies** to better support everyone's experience on Wikidata.

  If you envision yourself contributing in a specific way, please let us know so
  we can point you to the best resources to fit that need.
