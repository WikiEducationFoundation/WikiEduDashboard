title: "How linked data works"
summary:
content: |
  Thanks to HTML and the internet, we are accustomed to navigating from page to
  page through links. The concept of linked data is to extend this principle
  from pages to a much more detailed level: linking concepts, their relationships,
  and specific values in a semantic standard. You might have heard the phrase
  "semantic web" before. Linked data is the key to making these connections happen.

      star data as linked and open for the rest of the web to use.

  Similar to other kinds of databases, linked data is searchable or queryable.
  Since linked data can describe things and their relationships, people can use
  tools to answer questions about these things and relationships.
