  For our purposes, databases organize, represent, store, and make-searchable
  information.

  There are many kinds of databases. You might have heard about "relational
  databases" because they are very common and display information in tables (rows
  and columns), like a spreadsheet.

  As databases have advanced, programmers have been able to associate data with
  specific entities like people (ex. "Person A" has an address, age, occupation, etc.)

  This is possible by using **unique identifiers** (and **identifiers** in general)
  to describe relationships.

  Document-oriented databases are designed to structure data this way. Wikidata
  is a document-oriented database.
