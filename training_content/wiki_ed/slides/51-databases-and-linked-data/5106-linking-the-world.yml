  The fact that linked data is machine readable has far-reaching implications â€”
  from digital assistants to transparency to artificial intelligence.

  Imagine being able to not only link to a website, but be able to link to
  specific concepts, individuals, media, and relationships *within a website*.

  Wikipedia aims to share the sum of the world's knowledge. Imagine if you could
  organize that sum into similar concepts, values, and relationships. What if
  you could make all of Wikipedia a queryable database so that it could answer
  any questions you ask of it?

  What if you wanted to know every single city that currently has a mayor who
  identifies as a woman? To do this on Wikipedia editors would have to do the
  research and manually make a list of these mayors, then they would have to
  manually update it when a woman is newly elected...in every language version
  of Wikipedia. Shouldn't there be an easier way to do this?

  Wikidata, the linked data repository for all Wikimedia projects, can do this!
  For the answer to this question, click on <a href="https://w.wiki/4iR">this link</a>. This link is to a query
  of Wikidata. We will discuss queries in depth later, but they allow you to
  pull out specific pieces of data from Wikidata.
