title: "How do identifiers and databases work together?"
summary:
content: |
  Spoken language doesn't require unique identifiers. Items, concepts, and people are explicit thanks to context in conversation.

  Databases, however, do not have the luxury of context. Identifiers must be standardized in order for database systems to understand the relationship between individual pieces of data.

  Consider the amount of context that goes into giving this sentence meaning:

  *"Montevideo is the capital of Uruguay."*

  First you need to know that Uruguay is a **country** and that Montevideo is a
  **city**. Then you need to know that countries have this special kind of city
  which is called a **capital**. Montevideo is a capital, which makes it
  significant to Uruguay. (You'll also notice the sentence is in a language,
  specifically English, which linked data can handle elegantly.)

  Having unique identifiers for all things is powerful, but when the relationships
  between identifiers or the things that describe identifiers can have their
  *own* unique identifier as well then a database can "understand" how things
  relate to other things.
