title: "Open Data vs Linked Data"
summary:
content: |
  **Remember**: "Open data" is not synonymous with "linked data." Open data
  refers to data published without restrictions or control mechanisms. Documents
  (like PDFs or DOCs) can be published as open data, but that doesn't mean that
  they follow linked data standards. Documents can be published with closed
  standards like copyright or a form of encryption. Similarly, linked data
  does not have to be open. Linked data can exist in a password-protected system
  or exist on a local server, but still follow linked data formatting. Although
  these phrases refer to different concepts, combining them is very powerful.
  Wikidata happens to both follow open data standards (CC0) and contain linked
  data.
