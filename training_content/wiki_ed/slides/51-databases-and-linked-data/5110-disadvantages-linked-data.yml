title: "Disadvantages of linked data"
summary:
content: |
  * Schemas, ontologies, and taxonomies are inconsistent, which is confusing to
  experts, newcomers, and regular users.
  * It is complicated, which takes time to learn, use, and maintain.
  * Organizations must invest in staff to learn how linked data works.
  * There is a lot of data that is not linked yet.
  * Since there isn't an established schema, trust becomes very important
  (which is built into Wikidata!).
