title: "What are identifiers?"
summary:
content: |
  An example of an identifier is a social security number, ISBN for a book,
  Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), or a bar code number for a product. The core concept
  is that a number explicitly refers to a distinct thing, *type* of thing, concept,
  or individual.

  Systems like this have existed before databases. Consider Zip codes or Postal
  Index Numbers or longitude and latitude as examples of identifiers that refer
  to an explicit geographic area in different ways. (There are other non-geographic
  examples such as license plates, credit card numbers, phone numbers, etc.)

  If every point on the globe can be represented as a number, it's not such a
  stretch to imagine every single thing having a unique identifier associated
  with it.
