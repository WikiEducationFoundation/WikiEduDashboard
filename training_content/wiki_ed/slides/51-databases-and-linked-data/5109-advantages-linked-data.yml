title: "Advantages of linked data"
summary:
content: |
  * Linked data formats (like RDF) work well for mass editing.
  * Multiple ways of describing items (data models, ontologies, hierarchies)
  can exist within the same system (even conflicting values!).
  * Linked data can be edited, queried, and updated quickly.
  * By virtue of linking, more relevant resources will be more visible/easily
  discoverable to users.
  * The more information there is associated with an item, the easier it is for
  users to pivot to related concepts, associated images, or similar items in a click.
