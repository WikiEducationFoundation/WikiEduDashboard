  In this stage, you'll continue improving your draft and you'll incorporate the feeback you
  get from your classmates' peer reviews. You'll find links to the peer review page for each classmate
  who has signed up to review your article. (If the linked pages are blank, the reviewers haven't submitted
  their reviews yet.)

  This is also when you should complete your reviews of your classmates' drafts.

  Mark this stage *complete* when you're ready to publish your work live on Wikipedia.
