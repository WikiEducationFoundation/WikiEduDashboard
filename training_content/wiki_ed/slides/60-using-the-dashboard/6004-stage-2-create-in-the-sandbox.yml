  Once you've compiled your bibliography, it's time to draft your contribution. Follow the **Sandbox** link
  so that your draft will be easily accessible to instructors and classmates. The sandbox for your draft
  will include the name of the article you're working on.

  The ***Drafting in the sandbox*** training module has more details about how to use a sandbox for an existing
  article that you're improving versus a new article that hasn't been created yet.

  Mark this stage *complete* to indicate that you're ready for peer review feedback.
