  When you edit medical topics, your work will be seen by a group of editors
  with a sincere commitment to accuracy on Wikipedia's medical pages.

  Keep in mind:
  * Wikipedia's sourcing requirements may seem counterintuitive at times, but
  they are designed to prevent confusing verification issues.
  * Experienced editors sometimes treat medical content with a sense of urgency.
  That's because bad information on medicine, wherever it appears, is dangerous.
