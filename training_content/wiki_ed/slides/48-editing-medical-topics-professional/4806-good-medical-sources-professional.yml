title: What are good choices for medical sources on Wikipedia?
summary:
content: |
  Good sources:
  * are typically no more than 5 years old
  * summarize secondary sources or many primary sources
  * provide an overview of the current understanding of the topic
  * combine the results of several studies
  * are published independently of the research

  For example:
  * literature reviews or systematic reviews found in reputable medical journals
  * academic and professional books written by experts in the relevant field,
  from a respected publisher
  * medical guidelines or position statements from nationally or internationally
  recognized expert bodies

  Many reputable medical organizations like Cochrane or PCORI publish systematic
  reviews; these are great sources.
