  First, review one of your selected sources and the text of your article.

  Then, determine a place in the article where your source could help support a
  statement. Make sure the information you're adding isn't already covered in
  the article. If it is, check if that existing statement cites a source. If
  not, add yours!

  If you can't find an unclaimed statement, try adding 1-2 sentences to go along
  with your source as you learned in the [Adding citations training](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/sources).
