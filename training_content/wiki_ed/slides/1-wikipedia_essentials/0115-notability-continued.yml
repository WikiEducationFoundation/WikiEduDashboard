  **Notability: “Why this?”**

  Notability is an important first step, because it will help you pick your
  topic. So let’s look a bit closer at what makes a topic notable.

  The basic requirement for a topic to have its own article is:
  *significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.*

  * **significant coverage** means that at least a couple of sources talk
  specifically about your topic. Significant coverage is more than a trivial
  mention, though it doesn’t have to be the core focus of the book or article
  you cite. On the other hand, it should be more than a single mention or single
  line of text.
  * **reliable sources** generally means that coverage comes from secondary
  sources from reputable publishers. You want the book, journal article, or other
  source you're referencing to have a reputation for accuracy and fact-checking. 
  Those sources don’t have to be in English, and they don’t have to be online.
  * **independent of the subject** means the publisher doesn't have a stake in
  presenting a biased point of view (either positive or negative). For example, 
  self-publicity, advertising, self-published material by the subject of your article, 
  autobiographies, and press releases are not considered independent.
