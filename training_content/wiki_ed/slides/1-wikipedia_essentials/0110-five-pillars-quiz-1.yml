        Present the facts in a careful way, to persuade readers to draw certain
        conclusions.
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. Remember, a Wikipedia article should be neutral, balanced,
        and fair to all views. You want readers to have access to facts, and
        trust that those facts will lead them to their own conclusions. This is
        the policy known as [Neutral Point of View](./neutral-point-of-view).

        Replicate the best information from published authors, word-for-word.
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. You should be using reliable, published information, but you
        want to be very careful not to plagiarize, or closely paraphrase, those
        authors. Instead, you should seek out good information and summarize
        those facts using your own words.

        Share neutral facts from reliable sources that present all views
        in a balanced way.
      explanation: |
        Correct! Wikipedia articles should share neutral facts from reliable
        sources. When there’s a controversy, include a variety of viewpoints,
        but only if they are reflected in reliable sources.

        Include interesting first-hand accounts about the author’s experiences
        with the topic.
      explanation: |
         Incorrect! Wikipedia is not a personal webpage or blog. You don’t want
         to share personal stories, even if they relate to the topic matter.
         Instead, find trusted, reliable sources, and cite them.
