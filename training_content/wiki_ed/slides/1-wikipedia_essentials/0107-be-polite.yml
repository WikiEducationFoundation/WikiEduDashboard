  **Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner.**

  Don't panic if someone else edits your work, or removes your contributions.

  Every article has a Talk page where you can interact with the other Wikipedia
  editors who are working on your article. If you have a disagreement, keep some core
  Wikipedia values in mind:

  * Respect and be polite to your fellow Wikipedians, even when you disagree.
  * Avoid personal attacks. Talk to people you disagree with, and try to find
  consensus.
  * If you don’t agree with someone’s edit, don’t just “change it back.” That’s
  an edit war, and it could get you both blocked! If you have a persistent disagreement,
  talk to your instructor, or the Wikipedia Expert you'll find on your course page.
  They’ll help you get it fixed.
  * Act in good faith.
  * Never tell others to keep your edits, or to wait to make changes in an article, because you "need it for a grade."
  That isn't true! All of your edits are always saved and can be found by your instructor.

  Being respectful isn’t limited to disagreements. Being polite means responding
  to messages left by other editors, thanking people who help, and checking back after
  your edits to see if anyone has responded. Always be mindful of the community
  around you.
