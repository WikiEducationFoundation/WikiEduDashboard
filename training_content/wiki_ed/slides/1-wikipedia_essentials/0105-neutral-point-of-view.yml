  **Wikipedia has a neutral point of view.**

  Wikipedia articles should document and explain the major points of view in a
  balanced and impartial manner. Just the facts! Don't:

  * Debate or attempt to persuade readers
  * Share personal experiences or opinions
  * Share your own analysis of the information you find

  Of course, facts aren’t always clear cut. Some articles might have to describe
  multiple points of view. In those cases, present each view accurately, with
  context. Don’t suggest that one version of the story is "the truth" or "the
  best."

  **This is a big deal.** Anything you add to an article should be based on a
  published source of information, and you should always cite that information
  when you include it. (Don’t worry — we’ll show you how later on). That means
  citing published, authoritative sources that people trust.
