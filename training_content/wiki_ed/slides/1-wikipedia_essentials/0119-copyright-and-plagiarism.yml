title: Copyright and plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  You might think you know what plagiarism is, and how to avoid it. But
  Wikipedia is a little bit different. The rules cover not only copy-and-paste
  plagiarism, but also close paraphrasing and copyright violations. And the
  stakes are high: the consequences of committing plagiarism in a Wikipedia
  class assignment are the same as handing in a paper you didn't write.

  Plagiarism and copyright violations are disruptive and time-consuming for

  copyrighted sources onto Wikipedia is against policy.

  This video lays out what you need to know to avoid these pitfalls!
