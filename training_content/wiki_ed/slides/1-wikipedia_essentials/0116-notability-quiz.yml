        Soapy’s hot dogs. Your classmate has found a recent newspaper article
        about its opening, and found the Soapy’s hot dog stand official website.
      explanation: |
        Incorrect! Though some local businesses may have websites or local
        newspaper coverage, this doesn’t establish them as notable enough to be
        included in an encyclopedia.

        Snappy’s Sausage Stand. Your classmate has an old newspaper article
        about its opening in 1930, an article showing a presidential visit from
        1948, and an old advertisement stating that Snappy’s is the best hot dog
        in the state.
      explanation: |
        Incorrect! While these facts are notable about the hot dog stand, they
        don’t make Snappy’s a notable hot dog stand. Presidents visit many
        businesses in their campaigns, and advertisements are not reliable
        sources.

        America Dog. Your classmate has an old newspaper article about its
        opening in 1980. The stand is shaped like a poodle, which is a lot like
        a hot dog stand in another state mentioned in an architectural guidebook
        (though it doesn’t mention America Dog).
      explanation: |
        Incorrect! Though some local businesses may have websites or local
        newspaper coverage, this doesn’t establish them as notable enough to be
        included in an encyclopedia. And while its shape may be similar to
        another hot dog stand, America Dog isn’t specifically mentioned in the
        source.

        Dog Eat Dog. Your classmate has an academic journal stating that this
        stand invented the practice of putting a sausage on a bun. He has a book
        on the history of hot dogs that says the same thing. Finally, he has an
        interview with a hot dog historian mentioning Dog Eat Dog as the
        birthplace of the modern hot dog.
      explanation: |
        Correct! Dog Eat Dog is notable because it has been covered by several
        reliable sources for a unique contribution to American cuisine.
