    Let's say you've made a properly cited contribution to an article. Another
    editor removes it, but doesn't explain why. What is the best response?

        Add it right back in. If they wanted to remove something, they should
        have asked you.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! This is what's called an "edit war," and could get you
        blocked from editing! It can be rude for another editor to remove your
        contributions without an explanation. But Wikipedia requires you to
        "assume good faith" from other editors. If you don't understand
        something, ask about it on the Talk page, or ask your Wikipedia Expert for
        help. You'll find them linked from your course page.

        Explain what you added, again citing the source of that material, to the
        Talk page of the article. Or go to the user page of the editor who
        removed your content, and ask why they removed it.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! The best way to find out why something happened on Wikipedia is
        to ask why. It might illuminate a difference of opinion, or it could
        have been a misunderstanding. Assume good faith, and ask without
        accusations, and you can start to arrive at a consensus.

        Assume you used a bad source, or did something else wrong. Don't edit
        the article again until the due date, and hope your professor sees it
        before the other editor.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Wikipedia is "the free encyclopedia anyone can edit", and
        that includes you. If you aren't comfortable using the Talk page, or
        user page of the editor, there are other options. You can always ask your
        instructor, or the Wikipedia Expert listed on your course page. That's why
        they're there!

        Tell the Talk page that you're being graded, and that others should avoid editing the
        article until your teacher sees it. Write this message entirely in capital letters,
        to make sure other editors see it.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Remember, nobody "owns" articles on Wikipedia. Asking other
        editors to stop working on an article comes across as incredibly hostile
        (AND SO DOES TYPING IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS). Your contributions are always saved
        on Wikipedia. If other editors remove or change your work, your instructor
        can still see what you've contributed in the article history page.
