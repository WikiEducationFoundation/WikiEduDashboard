title: "Peruse the trainings"
summary:
content: |
  We'll assign trainings that guide you through specific Wikidata concepts.
  These trainings are embedded in the relevant weeks of the course Timeline.

  If you're curious about upcoming trainings or want to revisit content, you can
  find all course trainings in the **Resources** tab on your Dashboard course page.
  If you happen to end up on the **Training** tab of the Dashboard itself, make sure you
  take the "Professional Development Training Modules" rather than our trainings
  for students or instructors.
