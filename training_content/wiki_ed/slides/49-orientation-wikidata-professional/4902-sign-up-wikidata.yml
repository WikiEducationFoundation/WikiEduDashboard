title: "Sign up for a Wikidata account"
summary:
content: |
  Before we continue, you'll need to sign in to a Wikimedia account. **If you
  already have an accessible account**, skip this slide and click "Log in" in the
  upper right corner of this window. (Note: If you have a Wikipedia account, you can use that for this course).

  **If you don't yet have a Wikimedia account**, proceed:

  First, decide if you want your username to be a pseudonym or a
  version of your real name. Keep in mind that all Wikidata contributions are
  tied to your username indefinitely, including mistakes.

  In a moment, when you sign up, make sure to associate your account with an email
  address and respond to the confirmation email. Other Wikidata editors will be able to send emails to you, but your
  address will *not* be publicly visible. A confirmed email address is the only
  way to recover an account should you forget the password.
