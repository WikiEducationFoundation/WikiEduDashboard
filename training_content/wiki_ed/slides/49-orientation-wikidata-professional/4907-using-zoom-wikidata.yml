title: "Using Zoom"
summary:
content: |
  Zoom is an online video meeting platform. In Zoom meetings, you'll learn from
  Wikipedia Experts and your peer collaborators. Meetings will be recorded and
  linked from the Timeline.

  You will receive a Zoom link by email. If you have not used Zoom before, you will be prompted
  to download its launcher program. It works on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.
  The link will remain the same from week to week.

  If you cannot access the Zoom call by computer or app,
  you can also call in by phone. Please note that your ability to engage with
  the meeting will be significantly limited if you dial in by phone, as you'll miss
  screenshares, live chat, and other features. Enabling video in meetings is not required, but we encourage you to turn it on
  to the extent you feel comfortable.

  Among the many features Zoom offers, you may "raise your hand," which signals
  to the facilitator(s) that you have a question or comment. You're also welcome
  to simply start talking.

  Please try to connect in a location without a great
  deal of background noise, and mute your microphone while you're not
  talking.
