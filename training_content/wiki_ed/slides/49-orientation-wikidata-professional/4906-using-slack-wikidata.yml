title: "Using Slack"
summary:
content: |
  You will receive an invitation to join Slack at the beginning of the course.
  Slack is a chat/messaging service you can access via the web, the downloadable
  program, or the mobile app.

  This is where you can ask questions, share useful links or information, and
  coordinate any collaborative work with your peers. We will have a dedicated
  channel, visible only to course participants and Wiki Education staff. You
  can also send private or group messages.

  Wiki Education staff are in the Slack channel during normal business hours to help troubleshoot. If you have
  questions at night or over the weekend, you can still use Slack, as it is also
  a powerful tool for asynchronous communication.
