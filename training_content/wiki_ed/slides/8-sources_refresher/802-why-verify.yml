title: Why verify?

  You shouldn't trust everything you read on the internet, and Wikipedia is no
  different.

  What makes a Wikipedia article trustworthy is information that can be
  traced back to a collection of reliable sources. Each statement in an article
  should have a supporting source. Reference links in the text — in-line
  citations, which look like this<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%; font-family: serif">[1]</span>
   — connect you to the reference list at the bottom of the page.

  Before you start working on an article, make sure you have a collection of
  good sources. You should be using the best available sourced; don't just the
  first thing that shows up on Google.
