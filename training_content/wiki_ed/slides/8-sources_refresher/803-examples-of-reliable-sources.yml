title: Examples of reliable sources
summary:
content: |
  Reliable sources include:

  * Textbooks
  * Literature reviews
  * Books or publications written by experts in the field, and published by
  reliable publishers.

  Do not use:

  * Blog posts
  * Press materials intended to show something in a certain light
  * In some cases — such as articles that involve medical topics — newspapers and
  popular press articles aren’t appropriate either! (If that applies to you, be
  sure to check out our module on Editing Medical Topics).

  Ask your librarian for help locating good, reliable sources from reliable
  publishers written by experts in the field you're writing about.
