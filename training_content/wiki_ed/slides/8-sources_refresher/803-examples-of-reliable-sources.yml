title: Examples of reliable sources
summary:
content: |
  Reliable sources include:

  * Textbooks
  * Literature reviews
  * Books or publications written by experts in the field, and published by
  reliable publishers.

  Do not use:

  * Blog posts
  * Press materials intended to show something in a certain light
  * In some cases — such as articles that involve medical and psychology topics — newspapers and
  popular press articles aren’t appropriate either! (If that applies to you, be
  sure to check out our module on [Editing health and psychology topics](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/editing-medical-topics),
  which may already be assigned later in your course's timeline).

  Ask your librarian for help in locating sources that have been written by
  experts in your field of study and that have been published by reliable publishers.
