title: Gather your sources
summary:
content: |
  As you come across good sources, you'll want to gather them somewhere so you
  can find them when you 're ready to start writing. Your sandbox is a
  convenient place to collect them. Just add a section — you can call it
  "Bibliography", "Notes", or anything else you like — and use it to jot down a
  few notes about the source.

  Use the Cite tool to add a reference, and once you save it, the reference will
  appear at the bottom of the page. When you're ready to start writing, you can
  drag the citation link to wherever you want in your draft.
