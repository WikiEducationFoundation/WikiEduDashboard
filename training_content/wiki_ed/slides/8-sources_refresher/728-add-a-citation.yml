title: Add a References section

content: |
  Once you've reviewed a source and started drafting a summary, how do you let
  other editors know where to look to verify your information?

  First, check to see if the page has a References section. If there isn't one,
  click on the "Edit" option, and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Type
  the word References on a new line.

  On the Visual Editor's toolbar, you'll see the word Paragraph, with a down
  arrow next to it. Clicking on it produces a drop-down menu. Select "Heading".
  This should make the word References larger and underline it.

  Hit the enter key to create a new line. Then go up to the toolbar again and
  click Insert. Then select Template from the drop-down menu that appears. When
  the "Add a template" interface appears, type Reflist in the box. Click the
  "Add template" button next to the box, and then click on the blue Insert
  button in the top right corner.

  Then click Publish changes. Don't forget to leave an edit summary, something like
  "Added a reference section".
