  It can be helpful to copy and paste the text below into [a
  sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox?veaction=edit),
  and apply all of the options directly to this text to see what it does.

  **Paragraph**: Set the style of your text. For example, make a header or
  plain paragraph text. You can also use it to offset block quotes.

  <u>***A***</u> : Highlight your text, then click here to format it with
  bold, italics, etc. The “More” options allows you to underline
  (<u>U</u>), cross-out text (~~S~~), add code snippets ( { } ), change
  language keyboards (Aあ), and clear all formatting ( ⃠ ).

  **Links**: Highlight text and push this button to make it a link. The
  Visual Editor will automatically suggest related Wikipedia articles for
  that word or phrase. This is a great way to connect your article to more
  Wikipedia content. You only have to link important words once, usually
  during the first time they appear. If you want to link to pages outside
  of Wikipedia (for an “external links” section, for example) click on the
  “External link” tab.

  **Cite**: The citation tool in the Visual Editor helps format your
  citations. You can simply paste a DOI or URL, and the Visual Editor will
  try to sort out all of the fields you need. Be sure to review it,
  however, and apply missing fields manually (if you know them). You can
  also add books, journals, news, and websites manually. That opens up a
  quick guide for inputting your citations. Once you've added a source,
  you can click the “re-use” tab to cite it again.

  **Bullets**: To add bullet points or a numbered list, click here.

  **Insert**: This tab lets you add media, images, or tables.

  **Ω**: This tab allows you to add special characters, such as those
  found in non-English words, scientific notation, and a handful of
  language extensions.
