title: Pinging another Wikipedian
content: |
  To get a specific user's attention, you can “ping” them by writing
  `{{ping|Username}}` on a Talk page, which will send them a notification.
  Some Wikipedians have hundreds, or even thousands, of pages on their
  Watchlists so this is a good way to get their attention.

  If you're addressing a user on *their* Talk page, they will be notified
  whether or not you ping them. If you're addressing a user on your *own*
  Talk page or an article Talk page, you'll need to ping them.

  Remember to sign your message!

  If you want some practice, try introducing yourself to a classmate on
  that classmate's Talk page. To find another Talk page, go to the
  **Students** tab and click on the username of the student you'd like to
  leave a message. Then click **Talk** in the upper-left corner of their
  userpage.
