title: Take control of the text!

  Most of the time you'll use visual editing, but if you want to edit a
  Talk page or make changes in source editing mode, you'll need to learn a
  little Wikicode.

  The Wikicode for **bold** text is like this:

  `'''bold'''` = **bold**

  Creating a wikilink (that is, a link to another article on Wikipedia)
  looks like this:

  `[[bold]]` = [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold)

  That link to the article [Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness)
  will redirect you to [Emphasis
  (typography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_%28typography%29).
  To link to an article with a different name than the text, put a `|` (a
  “pipe”, inserted with ''shift + '' on most keyboards) in between the
  code and the word you want to appear on the page. Like this:

  `[[boldness|bold]]` = [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness)
  (with the link to [Boldness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness))
