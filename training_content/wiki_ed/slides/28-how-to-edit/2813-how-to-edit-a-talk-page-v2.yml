title: How to edit a Talk page
content: |
  Talk pages don't have a Visual Editor option, so you'll have to use
  Wikicode.

  To add a message to a Talk page, click the “New Section” button at the
  top of the page. Make sure to add your comments to the bottom of the
  Talk page, and to give your message a title.
