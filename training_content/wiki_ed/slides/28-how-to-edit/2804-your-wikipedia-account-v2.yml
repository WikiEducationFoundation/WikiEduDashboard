title: Your Wikipedia account
content: |
  You already have a Wikipedia account. Like most online accounts, you may
  want to retrieve a password. On Wikipedia, that means you need to opt in
  to adding your email address. If you ever forget your Wikipedia
  password, you can have it emailed to you.

  Adding an email address also allows other editors to contact you, and
  you can get email notifications whenever pages you're interested in are
  changed. Your email address is not revealed when other users contact
  you.

  To do this, log into your Wikipedia account. Click the link to
  **Preferences** in the upper-right hand corner of the site. Scroll down
  to “Email options.” You will be sent an email asking you to confirm your
  account. Click the link to confirm, and you're done!
