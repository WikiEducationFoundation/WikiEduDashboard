  :question: What should you do before making a substantial change to an article?
    For example, adding a new paragraph.
  :answers:
  - :id: 1
    :text: Read the Talk page of the article to see if there are conflicts, and share
      your sources and plan for changes there.
    :explanation: CORRECT! It's polite to let other editors know what you're intending
      to do, and what source you'll use. Don't worry if nobody responds. Just sharing
      your intentions is a good idea.
  - :id: 2
    :text: Copy and paste an entire article to your sandbox, make changes there, then
      copy and paste the article back to where you found it.
    :explanation: INCORRECT! This will delete the entire editing history of the article,
      and all of your changes will probably be reversed by another editor. Even if
      you plan to rewrite the entire article, it's best to make small changes to the
      article instead.
  - :id: 3
    :text: Nothing. Just make the edit; if someone doesn't like it, they'll revise
      it.
    :explanation: INCORRECT! While this is true up to a point, it's helpful to reach
      out to other Wikipedians concerning any changes you want to make to an article.
  - :id: 4
    :text: Find an experienced Wikipedian who is allowed to make the change for you.
    :explanation: INCORRECT! Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, including
      you. You can make the edit yourself. Of course, it's helpful to discuss planned
      changes with other editors first.
