  This training module shows you how to make edits to Wikipedia. You
  should have already completed the “Wikipedia policies” and “Sandboxes,
  talk pages, and watchlists” modules, where you learned about Wikipedia's
  community and the different types of pages you'll find on the site.

  By the end of this section, you'll understand technical details of
  Wikipedia so you can make your first edits.
