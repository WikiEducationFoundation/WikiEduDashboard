title: Visual editing vs Source editing
content: |
  Wikipedia gives you two options for editing. The **Visual Editor** lets
  you edit the text on the screen just as it appears on a Wikipedia page,
  similar to other word processing applications and websites. **Source
  editing** lets you see the underlying Wikicode, which resembles HTML.

  When you're using the Visual Editor, you can switch to source editing
  (and back to visual editing) by clicking the **pencil icon** at the top
  right.

  The Visual Editor simplifies the process of adding text, citing sources,
  linking to other Wikipedia articles, and formatting your article. Wiki
  Education highly recommends you use the Visual Editor when writing
  Wikipedia articles. However, this tool is only available for
  **articles**. To talk to other Wikipedians on Talk pages, you'll use
  Wikicode.
