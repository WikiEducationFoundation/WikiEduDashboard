title: Responding on a Talk page
content: |
  If someone leaves a reply or tags you with a question, you should
  respond.

  Open up the page just as you would open up an article to edit.
  Underneath the comment you're responding to, type a colon (`:`). Each :
  will indent your response deeper into the conversation. So if you
  respond to a response, use two colons, etc.

  It is **crucial** that you sign your messages with four tildes (`~~~~`)
  to automatically mark it with your username and a timestamp.
