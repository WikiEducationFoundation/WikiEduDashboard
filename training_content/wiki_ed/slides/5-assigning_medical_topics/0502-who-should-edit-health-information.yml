title: "Who should edit health information?"
summary:
content: >
  Based on feedback from instructors and experiences with hundreds of classes,
  we've found that Wikipedia writing assignments work best in the following
  scenarios:


  * Upper division classes, where students have familiarity with the subject
  matter.

  * Courses with fewer than 35 students.

  * Instructors who understand, and agree to follow, Wikipedia's unique sourcing
  requirements for biomedical statements.

  * If your course doesn't fall into all of these categories, we encourage you
  to explore assignments that don't involve content contributions related to
  human health. For example, students and Wikipedia could both benefit from
  biographical, historical, or cultural contributions relevant to your field of
  study.
