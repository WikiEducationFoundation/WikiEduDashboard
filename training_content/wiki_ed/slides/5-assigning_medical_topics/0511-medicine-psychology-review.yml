  * Wikipedia is one of the most-visited Websites for medical content. Just as
  accurate Wikipedia articles are a crucial public health service, poor content
  can have serious repercussions.

  * Primary sources, even from respected journals, are strongly discouraged, in
  favor of sources that could be verified by a non-scientist.

  * Secondary sources, especially literature reviews, systematic reviews, are
  preferred for all medical content.

  * When students share their bibliography ahead of time, it leads to
  constructive dialogue with the community, and minimizes the risk of
  introducing content which conflicts with Wikipedia's sourcing guidelines.
