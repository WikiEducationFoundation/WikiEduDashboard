summary:
content: >
  Medical and health-related content should be based on review articles, such as
  literature reviews or systematic reviews, from reputable journals and other
  professional medical literature.


  Let students know to look for a [secondary source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_source)
  in medicine: one that summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources to
  provide an overview of current understanding of the topic, to make
  recommendations, or to combine results of several studies. Examples include
  literature reviews or systematic reviews found in medical journals, specialist
  academic or professional books, and medical guidelines or position statements
  published by major health organizations.


  Popular press is generally not considered a reliable source for medical
  information.
