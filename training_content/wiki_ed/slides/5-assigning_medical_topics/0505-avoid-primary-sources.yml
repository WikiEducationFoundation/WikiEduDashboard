title: "Avoid primary sources"
summary:
content: >
  It can be helpful to define a [primary source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source)
  for your students as those where authors directly participated in the research
  or documented their personal experiences. If an author has examined the
  patients, injected the rats, filled the test tubes, or supervised those who
  did, that source isn't a valid source for medical claims on Wikipedia.
  Emphasize that many, but not all, papers published in medical journals are
  primary sources for facts about the research and discoveries made.


  Some clinical trials are well designed, others are not. It is not easy for
  nonscientists to tell which is which. So Wikipedia relies upon review articles
  over even "the best" primary sources. For medical content, Wikipedia considers
  original medical research to fall into that category. This includes clinical
  studies, case reports, and animal studies, even when published in respected
  journals.
