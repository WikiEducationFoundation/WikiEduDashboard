title: Sources and appeal to authority
summary:
content: >
  As we've said elsewhere, on the Internet, nobody knows if you're a dog â€” or a
  respected expert in your field. While the guidelines for citations around
  biomedical content may seem counterintuitive to a scientist, it's important to
  understand the context in which this information appears. Wikipedia strives
  for verification of every cited statement within it.


  While Wikipedians respect subject matter experts for guidance and advice,
  sources must be verifiable by anyone who encounters the article, at any time.
  That's why every statement should be referenced to a source that fits the
  established norms of Wikipedia.
