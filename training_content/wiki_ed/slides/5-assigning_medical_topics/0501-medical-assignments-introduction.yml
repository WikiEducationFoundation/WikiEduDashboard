  This training will get you up to speed on Wikipedia’s expectations regarding
  medical and health information. When it comes to health issues, Wikipedia is
  referenced more often than sites such as the National Institute for Health,
  WebMD, or the World Health Organization. That’s why it is critical for the
  information found on Wikipedia’s health-related topics to be as accurate as
  possible.


  Medical contributions are among the most challenging for student editors. Poor
  quality work on these topics can have real-world consequences for readers, who
  don't always bring the amount of skepticism they should to health-related
  content on Wikipedia.
