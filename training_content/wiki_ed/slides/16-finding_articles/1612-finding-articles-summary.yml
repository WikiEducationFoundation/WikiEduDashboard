  * Good articles to improve in class are:
      1. Rated low-quality but high-importance by a WikiProject.
      2. Not controversial.
  * You can find article assessments through WikiProjects in your topic area.
  You can find those WikiProjects on the Talk pages for most articles in that
  subject.
  * In order to establish notability for a new article, you'll want to have two
  or more independent, fact-checked and/or peer-reviewed sources with
  non-trivial information about the topic.
  * The Wikipedia Expert is on hand to help you with this process!

  Note that you can always come back to this orientation on the Training page of
  the Dashboard.
