  Wikipedia articles are placed into categories. You can see these categories at
  the tail end of every article. These categories are arranged into a
  hierarchical tree.

  Try going to an article related to your field. Scroll to the very end. You'll
  see a list of categories. Choose one, and you'll see a list of subcategories
  and related articles, sorted alphabetically.

  Scanning through these categories can be a quick way to find interesting
  articles. As you skim through, you can evaluate the article to see what can be
  improved.

  Categories also offer a good idea of articles you might want to create.
