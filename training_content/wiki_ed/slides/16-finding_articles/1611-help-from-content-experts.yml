  The Wikipedia Expert assigned to your course knows Wikipedia inside
  and out. Literally. They know what goes on behind the scenes, where knowledge
  is produced by Wikipedians. They also know how to create and format articles.

  If you need help determining good subjects for articles, or if you have a
  question about sources or topics, you should connect with them through the
  Help button on the top right corner of your course page.
