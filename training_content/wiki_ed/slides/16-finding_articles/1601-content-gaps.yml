title: Content gaps
summary:
content: |
  A Wikipedia assignment is different from almost every other writing
  assignment. This is also true when it comes to choosing a topic to write about.

  The core purpose of Wikipedia is to provide open, accessible information to
  the world. It's written by volunteers, who work to improve areas they're
  interested in. They summarize existing information from reliable sources on
  that topic.

  That isn't always information people are looking for. When people look to
  Wikipedia for information that isn't there, it's a content gap, and those gaps
  often include academic topics.

  So, there's a good chance that you can find articles in your field that need
  improvement. Let's look at bad options first, and then look at good ones.
