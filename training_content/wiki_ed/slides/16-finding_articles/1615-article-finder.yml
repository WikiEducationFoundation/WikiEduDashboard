  The <a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/article_finder">Article Finder</a>
  tool is another way to find articles to work on. The tool can be found on the
  **Articles** tab of your Dashboard course page, by pressing the
  "Available Articles" button. Once there, click the "Find Articles" button
  located at the top right of the page.

  When you search a keyword, you'll see a list of relevant articles. You can
  filter the results by quality, completeness, and how many page views the article
  receives per day. We recommend finding an article related to your topic that is
  low quality, incomplete, or read by a lot of people. Once you've located an
  article you want to assign you can add it to your available articles list by
  selecting the "add as available article" button.

  If you already have some articles you want to add while searching for other
  articles, you can add them by following these directions on the Available Articles
  section of the **Articles** tab.

  * Click 'Add an available article'
  * Enter the title (or paste the url) of the article you want to be available
  * Click 'Assign'
  * Repeat for each article.
