  The <a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/article_finder">Article Finder</a>
  tool is another way to find articles to work on. The tool can be found on the
  **Articles** tab of your Dashboard course page. Under the header
  "Available Articles", click the "Find Articles" button.

  When you search a keyword, you'll see a list of relevant articles. You can
  filter the results by quality, completeness, and how many page views the
  article receives per day. We recommend finding an article related to your topic
  that is low quality, incomplete, or read by a lot of people.
