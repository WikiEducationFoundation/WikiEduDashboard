title: A note on notability

  > "Subject isn't notable."

  Notability is an unfortunately ambiguous term. It may sound to you like a
  subjective appraisal on the relative merit or importance of that topic. On
  Wikipedia, though, notability means something else.

  Simply put, a notable topic has coverage in reliable sources. Preferably 3-5
  sources, independent of the subject, with a reputation for fact checking
  and/or peer review. The mention has to be more than passing. A sentence may
  not be enough; a chapter or an entire book probably is.

  This is particularly important when you're seeking to create a new article
  from scratch.

  When a topic isn't notable, it means that there's not enough written about
  them in reliable sources. Wikipedia is a summary of already-published
  knowledge. If that knowledge has gaps, so will Wikipedia.

  This can make it difficult to create articles about rural areas of developed
  countries. It poses challenges to writing biographies or histories among
  underrepresented groups, or many topics about women.

  However, with the assistance of a bibliography and your own expertise, you
  might be able to connect good sources to an unwritten topic. If that's the
  case, the contribution you can make is part of the crucial, ongoing process of
  expanding Wikipedia's coverage in these areas.
