title: Avoid the best articles on Wikipedia
summary:
content: |
  The best articles on Wikipedia are the worst articles to work on.

  Finding an article to work on isn't just about selecting a topic. It's about
  selecting a topic that needs improvement.

  Anything considered a "Featured" or "Good" article is probably a bad choice.
  That designation is indicated by a star (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg/20px-Cscr-featured.svg.png" />)
  or a green circle (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/19px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png" />)
  on the top right of the article. It's applied to articles that the community
  has already vetted. They meet a pretty high standard of writing, and come from
  a reliable set of sources.

  If you encounter a Good or Featured article, do not attempt to edit it.
  Instead, find related topics that are in need of improvement.
