  For new articles or qualifying expansions of stubs, compose a one-sentence “hook,”
  nominate it for “Did you know,” and monitor the nomination for any issues
  identified by other editors. Wiki Education staff can provide support for this process.

  For more information about how to nominate your article, see our resource for
  ["Did You Know" submissions](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Classroom_handout_-_Submitting_an_article_to_the_Did_You_Know_process.pdf).
