  Unsure about that edit you just made? Some Wikidata properties have guiding
  features called **property constraints** to show users how to enter the correct
  data and ensure that items will be formatted correctly.

  Properties express how two things relate to each other. In some cases, that
  relationship may be a number; in other cases, it may be another item. **Property
  constraints** describe the kind of values that properties can have.

  An example of a property constraint is the "allowed units constraint", which
  requires property values to be a specific unit (as opposed to text). The
  properties and qualifiers <code>P1082</code> (Population), <code>P2097</code>
  (term length), and <code>P670</code> (street number) all require a numerical
  value so they use this constraint.
