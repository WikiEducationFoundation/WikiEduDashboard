        If an item already has a reference you can't add additional references.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Statements can have multiple references. Note: If a new
        reference causes a statement to not be true, you will want to create a
        qualifier for that statement to distinguish the different values from
        one another.

        If the source you want to reference does not exist as a Wikidata item
        already, you cannot add it as a reference.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! You can add references that are external to Wikidata. You can
        also create Wikidata items and add them as sources.

        You can't add references that are "imported from Wikipedia."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! "Imported from Wikipedia" is a valid reference since all
        Wikipedia articles (should) contain references themselves.
