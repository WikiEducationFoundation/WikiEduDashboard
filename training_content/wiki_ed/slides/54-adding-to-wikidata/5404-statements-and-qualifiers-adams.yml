  Below that, we have **statements**. At minimum, a statement consists of an item,
  a property and a value associated with it. In this case, in addition to the
  item is Douglas Adams (<code>Q42</code>), we have the property "educated at" (<code>P69</code>) and
  the associated value, St John's College (<code>Q691283</code>).

  Below the property and value, you'll see **qualifiers**. Many statements support
  qualifiers — when did Adams attend St John's College? What degree did he earn?
  What did he major in? Some of these qualifiers are **constraints** — they're
  required values — while others are entirely optional. (We'll get back to
  constraints in another training.)
