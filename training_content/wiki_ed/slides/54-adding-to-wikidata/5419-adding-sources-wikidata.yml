title: "Adding sources"
summary:
content: |
  Look back at the statement you just added. Below it, there's a line that says
  "0 references". We need to fix that.

  Locate a source that supports your statement. Now click on the "+ add reference"
  link to add a reference. Wikidata will make some suggestions in the property box.
  Right now we'll look at some of the common ones

  * **reference URL** (<code>P854</code>) – use this if you want to use a URL.
  Just paste the URL into the value, and click save.
  * **stated in** (<code>P248</code>) – use this if you want to use a database,
  a book, a journal article, a newspaper article, or something similar. To use
  "stated in", the source needs to exist as a Wikidata item. If it doesn't,
  you'll have to create a new item.

  You can always learn more about sources by visiting
  <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Sources">Help:Sources</a> on Wikidata.
