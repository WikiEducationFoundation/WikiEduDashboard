title: "Add a statement with Recoin"

content: |
  If you have information for one of the missing properties, and there's a +
  symbol next to the property, you can click on it to enter the missing value.

  When you click on the symbol, a box pops up. Start typing and suggestions will
  pop up. Pick one (or keep typing until the right one pops up) and then click
  Publish. If no option pops up, and you get a pink box that says "No match was
  found", you may need to create a new item for that value.

  Once you have clicked publish, you are not done. Scroll down to the statement
  you just created and see if there's a ! or ? next to it, indicating there's a
  constraint issue. Fix it if you can (clicking on the symbol will give you some
  more information).

  Now you're a Wikidata editor!
