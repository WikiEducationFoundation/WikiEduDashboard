  So what's next? Adding a statement. But what statement?

  Ideally, you have a data model that tells you where to look, but what happens
  when there isn't one (or you aren't sure where to look)? Let's look for
  something similar, but more complete, like "Member of the Legislative Council
  of Hong Kong" (<code>Q27908372</code>). We've got "instance of" position, and
  subclass of "member of a legislative assembly".

      Wikidata recommends properties as you type them into the property field.

  Note that Wikidata suggests properties as soon as you click "+ add statement".
  "Instance of" and "subclass of" are the two most common properties.
