  Finally, there are references. References are a key part of creating reliable
  information on Wikidata. Without references, it's impossible to evaluate the
  quality or accuracy of the information on Wikidata.

  You may notice that the value has a Q number of its own. That isn't always the
  case; many values are simply numbers or text. But when the value is a thing
  (in this case, a college at Cambridge), it needs to be a Wikidata item itself.

  What happens if the item doesn't exist? In that case, you'll need to create it.
