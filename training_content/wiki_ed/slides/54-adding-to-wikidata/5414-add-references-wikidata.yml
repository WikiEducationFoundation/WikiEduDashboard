title: "Add a reference"
summary:
content: |
  We added a statement that seems like common sense — a member of an assembly is
  a member of an assembly. But what's obvious to you may not be obvious to others.
  There's a source, an academic book called *Politics in a Half Made Society*
  that's perfect for this.

  Click "+ add reference". Wikidata allows you to be specific in describing how
  you are referencing something. In this case we know this fact is **stated in**
  *Politics in a Half Made Society*. We can click in the property box and pick
  "stated in", and start typing.

  And we're done.
