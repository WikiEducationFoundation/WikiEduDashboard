title: "Add a reference"
summary:
content: |
  We added a statement that seems like common sense â€” a member of an assembly is
  a member of an assembly. But what's obvious to you may not be obvious to others.
  There's a source, an academic book called *Politics in a Half Made Society*
  that's perfect for this.

  Click "+ add reference". Wikidata allows you to be specific in describing how
  you are referencing something. In this case we know this fact is **stated in**
  *Politics in a Half Made Society*. We can click in the property box and pick
  "stated in", and start typing

  <figure class="alt-layout-100">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Adding_a_reference_to_a_Wikidata_item.png" />
    <figcaption class="image-credit">
      After you have a statement, you need to add a reference.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  And we're done.
