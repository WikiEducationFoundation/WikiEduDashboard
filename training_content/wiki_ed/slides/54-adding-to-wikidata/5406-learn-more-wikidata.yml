  Constraints guide editors to add data correctly by displaying a small icon
  next to the field that has a constraint. <a href="https://w.wiki/5Q5">Here is a list</a>
  of constraint descriptions. When they show up on an item they show up as an
  icon, like this image.

  Interested in learning more about constraints? You can browse items by
  <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_reports/Constraint_violations">constraint violations on this page</a>.
  An example of a constraint violation is distinguishing between two properties.
  The properties <code>P131</code>, *located in the administrative territorial entity*, and <code>P276</code>, *location*, both represent
  location in different ways. Constraint reports can help you discover and
  correct properties that are not used correctly.
