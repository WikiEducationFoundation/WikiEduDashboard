  Recall from the *Introduction to Wikidata* training module that Wikidata consists
  of items, statements about those items, and qualifiers.

  **Items**, which begin with Q, describe some entity in the world. <code>Q2</code> is the planet
  Earth, <code>Q42</code> is the writer Douglas Adams, and <code>Q4648</code> is the island of Bali.
  Because the Q-number associated with items is difficult for humans to remember,
  each item also has a label that gives the name of the item in English and
  other languages.

  Items are associated with **statements**, which describe various properties of the
  item. A statement consists of a **property** and the **value** associated with that
  property. For Bali, the property **instance of** has the associated value "island".
  That's just Wikidata's way of saying "Bali is an island". Properties, as you
  recall, are P-values â€“ "instance of" is <code>P31</code>.

  You don't need to remember P and Q values, Wikidata makes it easy to connect
  them with the associated labels.
