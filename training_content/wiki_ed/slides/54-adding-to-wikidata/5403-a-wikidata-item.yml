  This is an example of what a Wikidata item looks like.

  At the top are the **label** and the item **identifier** (the Q number). Each item has
  a unique item identifier that distinguishes it from all other items on Wikidata.
  The label is the name of the item in English (or whatever language you have set
  up). Because Wikidata is multilingual, it's possible that the label will be 
  different depending on the language you have set on your computer.

  Labels may not always be enough to help human readers distinguish one item
  from another. In addition to the well-known author Douglas Adams, there's a
  British painter (<code>Q21454969</code>), an American engineer (<code>Q28421831</code>), and even an
  American cricket player (<code>Q10268476</code>). So how do we tell them apart? That's
  where the **description** comes in. This Douglas Adams is described as an "English
  writer and humorist". Another description that might help identify him could
  be "author of the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*".

  Next to descriptions are **aliases** – in this case, we have "Douglas Nöel Adams"
  and "Douglas Noel Adams". While each item can only have one label (per language
  version) it can have multiple aliases. Like the description field, aliases help
  us to narrow down which specific Douglas Adams we're looking for.
