  This is an example of what a Wikidata item looks like.

  At the top are the **label** and the item **identifier** (the Q number). Each item has
  a unique item identifier that distinguished it from all other items on Wikidata.
  The label is the name of the item in English (or whatever language you have set
  as your default). Because Wikidata is multilingual, it's possible that the label will be
  different depending on the language you have set on your computer.

  Labels may not always be enough to help human readers distinguish one item
  from another. In addition Benjamin Frey, the Cherokee language expert, there is another
  Benjamin Frey (<code>Q38326649</code>), who specializes in medical research.
  With the exact same name, how do we tell them apart? That's
  where the **description** comes in. This Benjamin Frey is described as a
  "a sociolinguistic professor and researcher". Another description that might help identify him could
  be "advocate for the preservation of the Cherokee language".

  Next to descriptions are **aliases** â€“ in this case, we have "Ben Frey,"
  which demonstrates how this is an idea location for nicknames, formal names,
  and other kinds of aliases for people. While each item can only have one label
  (per language version) it can have multiple aliases. Like the description field,
  aliases help us to narrow down which specific Benjamin Frey we're looking for.
