  Write a reflective essay (2â€“5 pages) on your Wikipedia contributions.

  Consider the following questions as you reflect on your Wikipedia assignment:

  * **Critiquing articles**: What did you learn about Wikipedia during the
  article evaluation? How did you approach critiquing the article you selected
  for this assignment? How did you decide what to add to your chosen article?
  * **Summarizing your contributions**: include a summary of your edits and why
  you felt they were a valuable addition to the article. How does your article
  compare to earlier versions?
  * **Peer review**: If your class did peer review, include information about
  the peer review process. What did you contribute in your review of your peers
  article? What did your peers recommend you change on your article?
  * **Feedback**: Did you receive feedback from other Wikipedia editors, and if
  so, how did you respond to and handle that feedback?
  * **Wikipedia generally**: What did you learn from contributing to Wikipedia?
  How does a Wikipedia assignment compare to other assignments you've done in
  the past? How can Wikipedia be used to improve public understanding of our
  field/your topic? Why is this important?
