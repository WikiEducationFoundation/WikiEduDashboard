  Translating articles on Wikipedia builds bridges between cultures. There's a
  world of knowledge about historical figures, ideas, and events on other
  Wikipedias in other languages beyond the English Wikipedia.

  This training module will show you what you need to know as you find,
  translate, and polish a Wikipedia article.

  Ideally, you'll have already completed to introduction to Wikipedia module,
  and understand Wikipedia's culture. 

  By the end of this module, you should be able to answer:
  * How do I find Wikipedia articles in non-English Wikipedias?
  * What are the best practices for translating articles?
  * How do I move my translation from my sandbox workspace into the mainspace?
