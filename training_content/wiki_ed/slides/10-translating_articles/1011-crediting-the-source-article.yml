title: Crediting your source article
summary:
content: |
  Even if your translation varies widely from the source, you must credit the
  article you're working from.

  Here's how:
  * (a) When you create the new article (in your sandbox), or when you add
  translated content to an existing article, you'll be asked for an "edit
  summary." Add the following: `Content in this edit is translated from the existing French Wikipedia article at [[:fr:Exact name of French article]]; see its history for attribution.`
  * (b) Place the template `{{translated page}}` on your new article's Talk page.

  *When you add (a) to your edit summary, remember that the `:fr:` is the code
  for the language you are studying. If you don't know the language code, look
  to the URL of the Wikipedia you are translating from. You'll see a two-letter
  code at the start of the web address. For example: ja.wikipedia.org is
  "Japanese." So, you'd link to the article using `:ja:` rather than `:fr:`,
  which is the French Wikipedia.*
