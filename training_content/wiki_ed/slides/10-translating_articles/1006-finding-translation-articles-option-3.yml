title: "Finding articles: Option 3"
summary:
content: |
  Head to the Wikipedia in the language you are studying. In the search bar,
  type: `WP:GA` (this will also work with Wikipedias using non-Roman alphabets).

  You'll be taken to a list of "Good Articles" on that language's Wikipedia,
  the best articles it has to offer. (You may need to find the page that lists
  them, if it's separate).

  Find a Good Article on your target language's Wikipedia. Check the bar on the
  side to see if there is a corresponding article in English. If there isn't,
  great! You can translate the article into English, and contribute it to the
  English Wikipedia.

  Sometimes, the article exists, but is very short. That's OK, too.

  However, if both languages have well-developed pages on the topic, you will
  want to find another article. It can be very challenging to add content to an
  already-developed article.
