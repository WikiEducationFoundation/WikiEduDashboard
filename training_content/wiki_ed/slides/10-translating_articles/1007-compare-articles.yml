  Here's an example of an article from the French Wikipedia that would make a
  good candidate for translating into English.

  This is an article on Thumbelina the mini-horse, the world's smallest horse,
  as it appears on the French Wikipedia. It's listed as a "Good Article"
  equivalent on the French Wikipedia, which is indicated by a star at the top of
  the page.

  By clicking on the gray sidebar, you can see that English is listed. If you
  click on the English article, you'll see something very different.

  A quick glance shows that the French article on Thumbelina the mini-horse is
  significantly better developed than the English article. Looking closer,
  you'll see the French article relies on more, and better, sources.

  This is a great example of an article you can develop on English Wikipedia
  through translating the French article.
