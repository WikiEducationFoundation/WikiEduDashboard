title: Finding Wikipedia articles in other languages
summary:
content: |
  There are 290 Wikipedias. Each has its own language, and within those
  Wikipedias, the content is unique.

  For example, the English Wikipedia has more than five million articles. The
  Japanese Wikipedia, however, has less than one million; the Maori Wikipedia
  has fewer than 10,000.

  Because each Wikipedia is unique, so are the articles it creates. That means
  there's likely to be high-quality articles in another language's Wikipedia
  that you might not find on the English Wikipedia.

  How can you find high-quality articles in other languages?
