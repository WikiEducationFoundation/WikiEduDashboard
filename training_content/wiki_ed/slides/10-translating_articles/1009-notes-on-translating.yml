title: Notes on translating
summary:
content: |
  * Don't feel the need to maintain the structure or phrasing of the original.
  If you are working with an existing article on the English Wikipedia, you will
  likely find the two articles have a completely independent structure. Even
  with new articles, don't feel you need to make your translations conform to
  the original article.
  * If portions of the article appear to lack good sources, use your best
  judgment as you translate those sections. Go ahead and leave out unsourced
  material altogether (or provide references of your own).
  * It may be necessary to add material explaining terms or cultural concepts.
