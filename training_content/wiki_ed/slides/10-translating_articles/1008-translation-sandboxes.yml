  Your "sandbox" is a personal wiki page where you can practice editing, plan
  out articles, draft articles, or just experiment, without impacting the
  article "mainspace” on Wikipedia — which is what we call "live" articles.

  While you may have seen elsewhere that it's a bad idea to copy and paste an
  entire article into your sandbox, it's perfectly OK to paste a
  foreign-language Wikipedia article into your sandbox.

  However, it's **very important** that you copy and paste the WikiCode, not
  just the article.

  * Click "Edit source" at the very top of the article. You'll see the source code.
  * Copy the source code.
  * Paste the source code into your sandbox, and save it.
  * Verify that the original references have carried over to your sandbox version.

  If the references don't appear, do the following:
  1. Check that the bottom of the page has a "Notes" or "References" section. If
  not, type:  `==Notes==`.
  2. Check that the Notes section either has the text `{{reflist}}` or
  `<references />`. If not, type: `{{reflist}}`. This determines where your
  references will appear on the page.

  Adding this back in should auto-generate a list of references you've carried
  over. However, you can always reference the "Citing your sources" training
  module.
