  When looking for articles to translate, you're doing a great service to
  Wikipedia. There's already a backlog of articles that Wikipedians have
  requested someone translate into English.

  You can find this page by typing "Category: Articles needing translation from
  foreign-language Wikipedias" into the Wikipedia search bar. This will give you
  a full list of articles that Wikipedians have requested to have translated.
  This is an easy way to find articles, and to help out a fellow Wikipedian!
