title: Evaluating articles
summary:
content: |
  If you start from a "Good" article on Wikipedia, that means it's been
  evaluated by Wikipedians to contain quality sources. Other articles, however,
  may require a more critical eye.

  In any event, be careful to write your article with a neutral point of view,
  and to avoid ''original research''. In other words, avoid making connections
  or conclusions in your writing that don't exist in the source article.

  For more help on translating with a critical eye, check out the *Evaluating
  Wikipedia* brochure, or the "Evaluating Wikipedia" training module.
