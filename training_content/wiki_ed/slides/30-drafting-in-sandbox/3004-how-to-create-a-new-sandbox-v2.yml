title: How to create a new sandbox
content: |
  Feel free to work in your sandbox *or* create another sandbox off of
  your user page. You can create as many sandbox pages as you want by
  editing the URL after your username with the name of the new page you
  want to create.

  For example, to create a new page called “New sandbox”, first click on
  your username in the upper right when you're logged in. Now edit the end
  of the URL to look like this:
  <code><pre>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Username/<b>New_sandbox</b></pre></code>

  Click **Create** in the upper right to enter edit mode for a new page.

  Once you've added content, click **Publish page** to save what you've added.
  (It will still be a sandbox; "Publish" just means save.)

  If you forget the URL of this new page, don't worry! You can always find
  it in your **Contributions** history, linked at the top right when
  you're logged in.
