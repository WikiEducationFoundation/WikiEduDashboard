title: How to find a sandbox
content: |
  To find the sandbox for your assigned article, click the **Sandbox Draft**
  link for it from the My Articles section of your Dashboard course page.

  To find a classmate's draft sandbox, click their username from the Students tab
  of your Dashboard course page, then use the **Sandbox Draft** link. You can also share
  your sandbox URL with someone else, who will be able to see all that you've drafted there.

  (On Wikipedia you can also reach a generic sandbox by clicking the **Sandbox**
  link, which can be found at the top right of Wikipedia whenever you're logged in.
  This is not where you should draft your assigned article.)
