title: Drafting a new article?
content: |
  If you're creating a new article, it makes sense to get a first draft
  ready in a sandbox. That way, you can get a handle on some of the
  article structure, and develop a lead paragraph that contains everything
  you want to tackle.

  Write an outline of your topic in the form of a standard Wikipedia
  article's “lead section.”

  A “lead” section is not a traditional introduction. It should summarize,
  very briefly, what the rest of the article will say in detail. It should
  only include important, broad facts about the subject. After you've
  written your draft, revisit the lead to ensure all main points are
  represented in this important section. A good example is [Ada
  Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). See [Editing
  Wikipedia](https://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia) page 9 for more tips.

  Note that not all topics pass notability guidelines on Wikipedia, so
  review [the notability
  slides](/training/students/wikipedia-essentials/notability)
  from the Wikipedia policies training before doing too much work on your
  new article.
