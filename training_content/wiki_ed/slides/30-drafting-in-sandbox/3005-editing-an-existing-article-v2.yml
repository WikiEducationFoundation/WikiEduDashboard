title: Editing an existing article?
content: |+
  If you're editing an existing article, a sandbox is a great place to
  prepare your first updates by copying a *small portion* of the article
  that you want to change or expand. Do not try to overhaul an entire
  article from the sandbox.

  Identify what's missing from the current form of the article. Keep
  reading your sources as you prepare to write the body of the article.

  When you're ready to make edits:

  1.  Open the article you want to change in **Edit** mode. (References
      and other templates will break if you copy from **Read** mode.)
  2.  Select the portion you want to work on — a few paragraphs at most —
      and copy it.
  3.  Open your sandbox in Edit mode and paste the copied article content.
  4.  Add an edit summary that says copied from `[[article]]` with the
      name of the original article, then save it.
  5.  Re-enter Edit mode in your sandbox, make your changes, and publish
      them.
