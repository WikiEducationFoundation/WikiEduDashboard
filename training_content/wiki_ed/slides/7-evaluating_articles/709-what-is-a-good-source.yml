title: "What's a good source?"

  So, how do you decide if your source is suitable for Wikipedia?

  Information on Wikipedia must come from:

  * **Independent sources**, that is, those not directly related to the subject
  or written by the subject.
  * **Sources known for fact-checking and neutrality**, such as academic
  presses, peer-reviewed journals, or international newspapers.
  * **Reliable publishers** that represent a general consensus in the
  field (ask your instructor or librarian about a publication if you're not sure
  it's reliable).

  If you're going to be editing topics related to medicine, health, or psychology
  (these topics can show up in all disciplines), you should complete the
  [training module](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/editing-medical-topics)
  about the more strict source requirements for these topics. (The training may
  already be assigned on your timeline.)
