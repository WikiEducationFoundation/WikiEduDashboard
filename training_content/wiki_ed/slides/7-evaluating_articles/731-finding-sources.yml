title: Finding sources
summary:
content: |
  When you start looking for sources, don't just pick the first thing you find
  on Google. Instead, search through the academic databases that your institution
  has access to. The sources you'll find there have gone through a peer review
  process that make them more reliable than something random you might find on
  the internet.

  If you feel stuck, ask your instructor or your school's research librarian for help.
