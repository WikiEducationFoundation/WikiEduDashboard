title: When should you cite?
summary:
content: |
  In general, you should cite at least once per paragraph you contribute to
  Wikipedia. Any quotations, hard facts (such as statistics) and
  controversial claims must be cited.

  Basically, whenever you add information to an article, be sure to include
  references.

  Using AI tools? Remember, chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude will
  provide a citation if you ask them to, but it's rare for the fact to
  actually be contained in the citation the chatbot gives you, even if the
  source is real. Always read through sources yourself  to ensure
  information is verifiable (meaning you can find that fact in the source
  you're citing it to) before citing them on Wikipedia.
