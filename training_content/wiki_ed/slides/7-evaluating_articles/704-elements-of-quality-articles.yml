  The best articles share certain qualities, which can serve as a model for you
  to strive for in your own work:

  * **Detailed lead section**: the overview at the start of the article is clear
  and easy to understand.
  * **Clear structure**: there are several headings and subheadings arranged
  chronologically or by themes, with images or diagrams when appropriate.
  * **Balanced content**: the article covers many aspects of the topic, giving
  more weight to important viewpoints and less weight to fringe ideas.
  * **Neutral tone**: the article is written without bias toward a particular point of view,
  and represents all the different viewpoints that reliable sources have expressed
  about the topic.
  * **Good sourcing**: reliable sources are cited throughout the article and
  as much as possible.
