  So now you know how to contribute good citations to an article. Let's quickly
  look at what happens if you come back, and see that someone has made an edit
  to your page.

  You can see how an article has evolved over time by clicking the "View
  history" link at the top of every article.

  </figure>

  When you open the "View History" page, you'll see a list of recent changes to
  the article, with some comments about what other editors have done.

  In this example, on the page for Nellie Bly, you'll see that on July 15, an
  editor made a change to the "Asylum expose" section of her article. Others
  left more detailed descriptions. Tom Streissguth added a link to an online
  collection of Bly's newspaper articles, while CutOffTies removed an unsourced
  claim. What if you'd like to see what that unsourced claim was?

  You can compare histories between articles by clicking on the radio buttons
  next to each line:

  Then select the "compare history" button at the top.
