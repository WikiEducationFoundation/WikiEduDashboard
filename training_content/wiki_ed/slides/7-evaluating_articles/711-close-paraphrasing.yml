title: Close paraphrasing
summary:
content: |
  When you find a good source, it's important to share what you've found without
  plagiarising or violating the source's copyright.

  Paraphrasing your sources without plagiarizing them takes practice. It's easy
  to unconsciously mimic the structure and word choice of the original source.
  Copying words, structure, or phrases from the original source — even when
  cited to that source — violates Wikipedia’s copyright policies and is a form
  of plagiarism.

  The best way to avoid this is to find information from a variety of good
  sources, make sure you really understand the information, and then write it
  using your own words.
