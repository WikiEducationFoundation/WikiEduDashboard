title: "What's not a good source?"
summary:
content: |
  Other sources may be tempting and easy to find, but you should avoid using poor sources.

  Poor sources include:

  * Press releases and promotional material
  * Official websites
  * Self-published materials, like a CV

  While it can be useful to run a web search to help you find good sources (such
  as books or scholarly articles), it's usually more effective to ask your librarian
  for help in finding good, scholarly sources.
