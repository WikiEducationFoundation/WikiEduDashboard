title: "What's not a good source?"
summary:
content: |
  Other sources may be tempting and easy to find, but you should avoid using poor sources.

  Poor sources include:

  * Press releases and promotional material
  * Official websites
  * Self-published materials, like a CV
  * Social media posts
  * Other Wikipedia articles

  While it can be useful to run a web search to help you find good sources (such
  as books or scholarly articles), it's usually more effective to ask your librarian
  for help in finding good, scholarly sources.

  AI-powered chatbots can help find sources, but you should always start by
  searching through scholarly databases first, as many sources chatbots find
  will not meet Wikipedia's sourcing policy (even if the chatbot says they do).
