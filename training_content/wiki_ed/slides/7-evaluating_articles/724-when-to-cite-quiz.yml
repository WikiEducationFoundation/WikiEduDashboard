        Only when you use a direct quote from the author.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! You should avoid direct quotes whenever possible, but when
        you use them, you should cite them. However, it's not the only time you
        need to cite a source.

        When you find one that supports what you want to say.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! You should only say what you find in a source. That way,
        you'll avoid writing biased articles, or articles that skew toward a
        particular viewpoint (your own).

        Only when someone adds the "citation needed" tag to your article.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! While you should pay attention to the "citation needed" tag,
        you always use sources to begin with.
