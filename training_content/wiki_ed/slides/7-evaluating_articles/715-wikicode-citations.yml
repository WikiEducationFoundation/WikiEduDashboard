title: Add a citation with WikiCode
summary:
content: |
  You can also add a citation using wikicode.

  You can access wikicode from edit mode by clicking the pencil icon and selecting
  "Source editing".

  Then, follow these instructions:
  1. Check that the bottom of the page has a "References" or "Notes" section. If
  not, type:  `==References==`.
  2. Check that the References section either has the text `{{reflist}}` or
  `<references />`. If not, type: `{{reflist}}`. This determines where your
  references will appear on the page.
  3. Now click after the text you would like to create a reference for.
  4. Now type in the `<ref>` tag before your reference and type `</ref>` after
  your reference. Wiki software will automatically add your inline reference
  number.
