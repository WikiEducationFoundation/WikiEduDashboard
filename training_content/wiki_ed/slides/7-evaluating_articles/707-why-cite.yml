title: Why cite?
summary:
content: |
  *Everything* you write on Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable source.

  Wikipedians are working to create an accurate encyclopedia. Adding sources
  means that your work can be fact-checked by these editors.

  Editors (yourself included) can challenge unreferenced statements by adding a
  `{{fact}}` tag in wikicode, which adds a *[citation needed]* tag to the
  statement. Some editors remove unreferenced material on sight.
