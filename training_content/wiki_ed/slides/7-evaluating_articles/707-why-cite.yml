title: Why cite?
summary:
content: |
  *Everything* you write on Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable source.

  Wikipedians are working to create an accurate encyclopedia. Adding sources
  means other editors and readers can fact-check the claims.

  Editors (yourself included) can challenge unreferenced statements by adding a
  `{{fact}}` tag in Wikicode, which adds a *[citation needed]* tag to the
  statement. Remember, editors may remove unreferenced material on sight, so
  adding a citation helps prevent your work from being deleted.
