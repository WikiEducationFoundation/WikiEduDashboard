title: Evaluating article quality
summary:
content: |
  An important tool for evaluating a Wikipedia article is to look at its
  **quality rating**.

  Wikipedia articles are constantly being improved, and all at a different pace.
  Some rival the best encyclopedias, but others are out of date or incomplete.

  Volunteers review articles and leave a rating on the Talk page. You can
  find this by clicking "Talk" at the top left of the article.

  High quality articles have been evaluated as "Good" or "Featured" articles. These
  are the best that Wikipedia has to offer, and the rating reflects a consensus
  among Wikipedians. It can be harder to find ways to improve a Good or Featured
  article, and any major edits should be mentioned on the article's Talk page before
  changes are made.

  "Start" or "Stub" class articles aren't considered as reliable, or simply
  don't provide a strong overview of the topic. These are great articles to
  work on, because there's lots you can do, and you can make a dramatic impact.
