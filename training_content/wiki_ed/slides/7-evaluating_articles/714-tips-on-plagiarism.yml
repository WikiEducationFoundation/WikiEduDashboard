title: Tips on plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  * Material in your sandbox is still subject to Wikipedia’s policies, so do not
  copy and paste information from your sources into your sandbox.
  * Start by taking notes of key concepts, not phrases, from your sources,
  noting where each came from.
  * Write the draft from your notes rather than from the original source, so you
  are not unconsciously mimicking the original author’s structure or diction.
  * The more sources you use, the better you’ll understand the topic, which can
  help you paraphrase and summarize it in your own words.
