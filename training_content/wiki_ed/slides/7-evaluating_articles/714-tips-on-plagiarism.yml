title: Tips on plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  * Material in your sandbox is still subject to Wikipedia’s policies, so do not
  copy and paste information from your sources into your sandbox.
  * Start by taking notes of key concepts, not phrases, from your sources,
  noting where each came from.
  * Write the draft from your notes rather than from the original source, so you
  are not unconsciously mimicking the original author’s structure or diction.
  * The more sources you use, the better you’ll understand the topic, which can
  help you paraphrase and summarize it in your own words.
  * Don't use AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT or NotebookLM to summarize sources.
  Often, their summaries too closely mirror the structure of the original source,
  so if you rely on that summary, you may be accused of plagiarism. (Chatbots
  also often subtly distort meaning, making their summaries not good for Wikipedia,
  where validity of facts is critical.)
