        Copying a sentence from a source and changing the words to synonyms you
        find in a thesaurus.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Changing the words, while maintaining or just slightly
        changing the structure of a text, is "close paraphrasing," a form of
        plagiarism.

        Copying a lengthy passage from a book, but providing the name of the
        author and citing it.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Copying a lengthy portion of a copyrighted book or article is
        still a violation of the author's copyright. Unless the book is under a
        free license or public domain, you shouldn't copy it.

        Using it to craft a compelling and emotional call to action about a
        pressing human rights issue.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! While you can use Wikipedia and good sources to write about
        human rights issues you care about, avoid writing to persuade readers.
        Trust that others will read the information you share and come to their
        own conclusions about your issue. Remember, the more balanced your
        article is, the more likely critical readers are to trust the
        information you share.
