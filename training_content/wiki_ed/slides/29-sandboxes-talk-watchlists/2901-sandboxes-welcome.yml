  This training module walks you through different types of pages you'll
  find on Wikipedia.

  You read that right! There are *article* pages, which are what most
  people think of when they think of Wikipedia. On Wikipedia, you'll find
  **User pages**, **Sandboxes**, **Talk pages**, **Watchlists**,
  **WikiProjects**, and more.

  In this training, we'll review:

  -   The differences between these pages
  -   Where you can practice editing
  -   How and where to talk to other Wikipedia editors
