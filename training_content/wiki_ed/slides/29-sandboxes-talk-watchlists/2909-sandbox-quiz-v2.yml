  - :id: 1
    :text: A good place to copy-and-paste source material from copyrighted sources
      to paraphrase later.
    :explanation: INCORRECT! Your sandbox is still public, so you shouldn't use it
      to hold copyrighted material.

    :text: A good place to talk to other Wikipedians.
    :explanation: INCORRECT! The sandbox is public, but it's unlikely other Wikipedians
      will visit it, unless you link to it from somewhere else. To talk to Wikipedians,
      visit the Talk page of an article, or go to their Userpage.

    :text: A place to draft your article, or experiment with layout and structuring
      a page.
    :explanation: CORRECT! You can do whatever you want, formatting-wise, on your
      Sandbox page. It's a great place to practice WikiCode or VisualEditor, and to
      play with structuring a new article. Wikipedians concerning any changes you
      want to make to an article.

    :text: A place to copy and paste an article to make changes to it.
    :explanation: INCORRECT! Don't copy and paste an entire article into your Sandbox.
      You'll want to tackle articles by making small changes to the original article.
      If you want to merge parts of your sandbox with an existing article, check out
      the Sandbox training module, which is different from this one.
