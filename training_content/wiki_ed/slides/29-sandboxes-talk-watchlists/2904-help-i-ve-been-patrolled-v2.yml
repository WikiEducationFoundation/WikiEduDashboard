title: Help! I've been patrolled!
content: |
  Every new page on Wikipedia is vulnerable to people with malicious
  intent.

  To prevent that, other trusted Wikipedians will review them.

  When a volunteer reviewer checks out your page and says it's OK, they
  may mark it as being “patrolled.” While that sounds like you've done
  something wrong, it's actually a good thing: They're letting other
  Wikipedians know that they checked out your work, and it isn't spam or
  otherwise problematic.
