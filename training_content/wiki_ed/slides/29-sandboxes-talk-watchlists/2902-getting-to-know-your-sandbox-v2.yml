title: Getting to know your sandbox
content: |
  A
  “[sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox?veaction=edit)”
  is your personal wiki page where you can practice editing, plan out
  articles, draft articles, or just experiment. You can change your
  sandbox without impacting the article "mainspace” on Wikipedia — which
  is what we call live articles.

  People can still see your sandbox if they have the link, so it's
  important that the content you put there isn't something you don't want
  people to see. This also means you shouldn't copy and paste things there
  that might violate copyright rules (you'll take trainings about drafting
  in the sandbox and how to avoid copyright issues later).

  To find your sandbox, click the **Sandbox** link, which can be found at
  the top right of Wikipedia whenever you're logged in.
