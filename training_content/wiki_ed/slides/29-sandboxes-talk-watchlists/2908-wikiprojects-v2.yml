  A WikiProject is a page where Wikipedia editors have organized around a
  particular topic in order to systematically improve that topic and keep
  track of their progress. Some WikiProjects are more active than others;
  it all depends on the editors involved.

  WikiProjects can be a good place to look for articles that need
  improving in a particular subject, as some of the projects keeps lists
  of undeveloped or missing articles.
