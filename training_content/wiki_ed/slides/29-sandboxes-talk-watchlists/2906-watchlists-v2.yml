  How do you know when an article has changed, or if other editors have
  suggestions?

  A personal Watchlist is an easy way to keep track of all the pages
  you're involved in. You can use your Watchlist to monitor article
  changes, conversations, and collaborations.

  To add any page to your “Watchlist”, make sure you're logged in. Then
  just click on the star next to the “View history” tab on any Wikipedia
  page. When it turns blue, it's on your Watchlist. See your Watchlist by
  clicking “Watchlist” at the very top of your page when you're logged in.

  When you add an article to your Watchlist, it also “watches” that
  article's Talk page. If someone responds to your article edits on the
  Talk page, it will show up on your Watchlist.

  You can set your email preferences to receive email whenever pages on
  your Watchlist are changed by clicking the “Preferences” tab at the top
  of Wikipedia and scrolling down to “email options.” Then check the box
  that reads “Email me when a page or a file on my Watchlist is changed.”
