  Behind every great Wikipedia article are Wikipedians working together
  to make it great. These Wikipedians coordinate their work through
  a "Talk page."

  Every Wikipedia article has its own Talk page. The Talk page is where conversations
  about the article take place.

  Before you start editing an existing article, take a look at the Talk page. You can get a sense of
  the discussions that are underway. Talk pages are a good place to
  introduce your plans to improve that article. Share the books or articles you want to
  use to improve the article, and ask questions if you have them. Wikipedians with an interest in the
  topic will often take note and try to help. It's nice to post things in
  advance of making your edits, but you don't have to wait for "permission" to
  make a change. Remember: Be bold!

  To add a message, click the "New Section" button at the top of the page. Make sure to add your
  comments to the bottom of the Talk page, and to give your message a title.

  Wikipedians assume you'll be reading messages left in your user Talk page and
  article Talk pages. You can use these pages to leave messages for others, too.

  Remember, you have to use WikiCode on the Talk page. There's no visual editing option.
