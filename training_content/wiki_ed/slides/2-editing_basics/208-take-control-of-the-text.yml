title: Take control of the text!
summary:

  Most of the time you'll use visual editing, but if you want to edit a Talk page
  or make changes in source editing mode, you'll need to learn a little Wikicode.

  The wiki code for **bold** text is like this:

  `'''bold'''`  =  **bold**

  Creating a wikilink (that is, a link to another article on Wikipedia) looks like this:

  `[[bold]]` = [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold)

  That link to the article [Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold) will redirect you
  to [Emphasis (typography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_%28typography%29).
  To link to an article with a different name than the text, put a `|` (a
  "pipe", inserted with *shift + \\* on most keyboards) in between the code and
  the word you want to appear on the page. Like this:

  `[[boldness|bold]]` = [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness) (with the link to
  [Boldness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness))
