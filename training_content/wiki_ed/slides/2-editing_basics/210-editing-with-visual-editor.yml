title: Editing Wikipedia using the visual editor
summary:
content: |
  When you edit an article on Wikipedia, you can use the visual editor, which doesn't need WikiCode.

  If you're following along on another page, click the "Edit" button. If you're
  in source editing mode, switch to visual editing using the pencil icon at the
  top right.

  You'll see a toolbar with a few different options:

  <figure style="width: 100%">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/VisualEditor_toolbar_isolated-en.png" />
  </figure>

  This layout is similar to what you might see on a blogging platform or social media site.

  Let's quickly review each option.
