  Once you've made your edit, look for the "Publish changes" button at the top right in
  the visual editor, or the "Publish changes" button beneath the text area in WikiCode.

  For both, you'll want to add what's called an "Edit summary." Describe what you just did,
  so other editors can make sense of your edits. For example, if you added a citation, you
  would write "added citation," followed by why. For smaller edits you copyedited or fixed
  a grammatical mistake, you could write "c/e" for copyedit. There's no real "official shorthand,"
  just make sure you convey the intent of the action you took when you edited the page.

  With visual editing, you'll be asked for your edit summary after you click "Publish changes".
  With source editing, you'll want to type your edit summary before you publish.
