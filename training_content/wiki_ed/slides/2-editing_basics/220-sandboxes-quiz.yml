        A good place to copy-and-paste source material from copyrighted sources
        to paraphrase later.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Your sandbox is still public, so you shouldn't use it to hold
        copyrighted material.

        A good place to talk to other Wikipedians.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! The sandbox is public, but it's unlikely other Wikipedians
        will visit it, unless you link to it from somewhere else. To talk to
        Wikipedians, visit the Talk page of an article, or go to their Userpage.

        A place to draft your article, or experiment with layout and structuring
        a page.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! You can do whatever you want, formatting-wise, on your Sandbox
        page. It's a great place to practice WikiCode or VisualEditor, and to
        play with structuring a new article.

        A place to copy and paste an article to make changes to it.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Don't copy and paste an entire article into your Sandbox.
        You'll want to tackle articles by making small changes to the original
        article. If you want to merge parts of your sandbox with an existing
        article, check out the Sandbox training module, which is different from
        this one.
