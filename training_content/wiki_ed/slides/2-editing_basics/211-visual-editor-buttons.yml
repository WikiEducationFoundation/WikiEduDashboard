  It can be helpful to copy and paste the text below into
  [a sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox?veaction=edit),
  and apply all of the options directly to this text to see what it does.

  **Paragraph:** This helps you set the style of the text. For example, a
  header, or plain paragraph text. You can also use it to offset block quotes.

  ***A*** : Highlight your text, then click here to format it with bold,
  italics, etc. The "More" options allows you to underline, add code snippets,
  and change language keyboards.

  **Links:** The chain button allows you to link your text. Highlight the word,
  and push the button. The visual editor will automatically suggest related Wikipedia
  articles for that word or phrase. This is a great way to connect your article
  to more Wikipedia content. You only have to link important words once,
  usually during the first time they appear. If you want to link to pages
  outside of Wikipedia (for an "external links" section, for example) click on
  the "External link" tab.

  **Cite:** The citation tool in the visual editor helps format your citations. You
  can simply paste a DOI or URL, and the visual editor will try to sort out all of the
  fields you need. Be sure to review it, however, and apply missing fields
  manually (if you know them). You can also add books, journals, news, and
  websites manually. That opens up a quick guide for inputting your citations.
  Finally, you can click the "re-use" tab if you've already added a source and
  just want to cite it again.

  **Bullets:** To add bullet points or a numbered list, click here.

  **Insert:** This tab lets you add media, images, or tables.

  **Ω** The final tab allows you to add special characters, such as those found
  in non-English words, scientific notation, and a handful of language extensions.
