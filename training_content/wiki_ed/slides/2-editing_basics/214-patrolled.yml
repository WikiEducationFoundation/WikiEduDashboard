title: Help! I've been patrolled!
summary:
content: |
  Every new page on Wikipedia is vulnerable to people with malicious intent. 
  
  To prevent that, other trusted Wikipedians will review them.

  When a volunteer reviewer checks out your page and says it's OK, they may mark it as
  being "patrolled." While that sounds like you've done something wrong, it's
  actually a good thing: They're letting other Wikipedians know that they
  checked out your work, and it isn't spam or otherwise problematic.
