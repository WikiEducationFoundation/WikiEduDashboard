title: Visual editing vs Source editing
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia gives you two options for editing. **Visual editing** lets you edit
  the text on the screen just as it appears on the page. The **Source editing**
  option lets you see the underlying WikiCode.

  When you're using the visual editor, you can switch to source editing (and
  back to visual editing) by clicking the pencil icon at the top right.

  The visual editor makes it easy to add text, cite sources, create links, and
  do basic formatting. However, it is only available for articles. To talk to
  other Wikipedians, you'll use WikiCode.
