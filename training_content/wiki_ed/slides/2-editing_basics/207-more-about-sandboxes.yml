title: Sandboxes (continued)
summary:
content: |
  If you're enrolled in a course on this dashboard, then your sandbox page was
  automatically set up. Later on, you can use a sandbox (you can create as many
  as you need) to work on content for Wikipedia.

  It's also handy to leave the section at the top — a *template* — that says
  "this is a user sandbox". In source editing mode, you can see the WikiCode for
  that template, something like `{{dashboard.wikiedu.org sandbox}}`.

  Go to your sandbox and try out some of the WikiCode edits you learned a couple
  slides back. Try to add some bold text, or link to another article. Don't forget
  to add an edit summary!

  <div class="training__button-container"><a target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary" href="/redirect/sandbox/sandbox">
    Go to your sandbox and try these out!
  </a></div>
