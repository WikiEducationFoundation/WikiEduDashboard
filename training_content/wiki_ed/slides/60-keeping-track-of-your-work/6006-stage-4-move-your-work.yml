  In this stage, you'll move from your sandbox to a live Wikipedia article. Details on how to do that
  are in the ***Moving work out of the sandbox*** training module.

  Once you've made the transition out of your sandbox, you can mark this stage as complete. You can
  continue improving the live Wikipedia article from there until the final due date (and beyond,
  if you like).
