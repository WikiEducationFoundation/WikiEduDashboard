title: "Add the article you're working on"

  The My Articles section of your course page is for keeping track of the main articles
  you'll be focusing on for your Wikipedia project: the one(s) you're creating or improving
  and the ones your classmates are working on that you will peer review.

  When it's time to choose your article(s), go to the Home tab of your course and click the
  **Assign myself an article** button. You'll be able to:
    * choose from any available articles your instructor compiled ahead of time;
    * search Wikipedia by keyword to find an underdeveloped article; or
    * enter the title or URL of the article you've chosen.

  Once you've assigned yourself an article, you'll get a set of links and tools along with a progress
  tracker to show where to go for each stage of the assignment. For group assignments, the
  **Sandbox Draft** link will point to the sandbox of the first group member who signs up for the article
  so that you can work together in the same sandbox.
