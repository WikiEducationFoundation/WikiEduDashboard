  Today, you'll spend a few minutes practicing your editing.

  To start, find an article to edit. If you've chosen to improve an existing
  article for this process, you can choose that article for this exercise.

  Read through the article, thinking about ways to improve the language,
  such as fixing grammatical mistakes. When you're ready,
  click "edit" and make the appropriate changes, saving each edit with an edit summary when you're done.
  You don’t need to contribute new information to the article.
