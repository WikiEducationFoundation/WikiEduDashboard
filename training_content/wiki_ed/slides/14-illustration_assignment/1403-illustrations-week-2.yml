title: "Week 2: Choosing and illustrating topics"
summary:
content: |
  Students start reviewing articles and select those they think they could
  improve through illustrative content. Depending on your course, you could
  restrict media forms (photographs for a photography course, for example;
  digital videos for a production course; or scientific diagrams as a complement
  to a science course, are all good examples).

  Some instructors might make a list of articles relevant to the course that
  need illustrating.

  Students can start uploading content to Wikimedia Commons right away. Image
  assignments can take as few as two weeks, while more in-depth assignments,
  such as video production, may require longer time spent creating media.
