title: "Week 1: Ground rules"
summary:
content: |
  In the first week, the instructor introduces Wikipedia and its sister site,
  Wikimedia Commons. Commons is a repository for free-licensed content,
  including photographs, video, illustrations and diagrams. Uploading content to
  Wikimedia Commons means it can be more easily found for inclusion in other
  open-source projects.

  Students take the training module on "Illustrating Wikipedia", which explains
  free licenses and the practical steps to uploading content they create.

  Students can upload images (.png, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, .tif, .svg, .xcf),
  audiovisual files (.mid, .ogg, .oga, .flac, .flac, .wav, .webm) and certain
  types of (scanned) document formats (.pdf, .djvu), either to Wikipedia or
  (preferably) to Wikimedia Commons.
