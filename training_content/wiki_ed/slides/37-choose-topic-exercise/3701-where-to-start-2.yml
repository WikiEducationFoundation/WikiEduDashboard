  For this exercise, you will find several possible topics to consider as the main focus
  of your Wikipedia writing assignment, then list and analyze them on a sandbox page.

  Here's how you can begin your search for articles to improve:

  * Click on the [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Categories)
  at the bottom of relevant articles. These will provide you with lists of related topics.
  * Specifically search for [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stub_categories)
  articles in your field of study.
  * See if there is a relevant "[WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory)"
  related to your course.
