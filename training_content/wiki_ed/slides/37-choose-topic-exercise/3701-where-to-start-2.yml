  In this exercise, you will start to explore topics for your main Wikipedia contribution.
  You'll begin by listing several options in your sandbox and analyzing their potential for improvement.

  Here's how you can begin your search for articles to improve:

  * Click on the [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Categories)
  at the bottom of relevant articles. These will provide you with lists of related topics.
  * Specifically search for [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stub_categories)
  articles in your field of study.
  * See if there is a relevant "[WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory)"
  related to your course.
