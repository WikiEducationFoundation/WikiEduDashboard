title: "Writing a new article"

  While the vast majority of students we support contribute to existing entries
  on Wikipedia, you may wish to write an entirely new entry. If you choose to
  write a new article, be sure that:

  * The information does not already exist on Wikipedia either under a different
  title or in another article.
  * The topic meets Wikipedia's [notability](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/wikipedia-essentials/notability)
  requirements.
  * The material you'd like to add warrants its own article. Often new material
  should be placed in existing articles.
