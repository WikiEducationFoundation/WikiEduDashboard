  and make sure you're logged in, then return here to continue.

  On your [Article Selection](/redirect/sandbox/Choose_an_Article?veaction=edit&preload=Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org_choose_article)
  page, begin to list potential topics that you'd like to work on. Refer back to
  the [Evaluate an Article](/redirect/sandbox/Evaluate_an_Article?veaction=edit&preload=Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org_evaluate_article)
  exercise, and begin to write brief critiques of the articles you're considering.

  * Is the article's content relevant to the topic?
  * Is it written neutrally?
  * Does each claim have a citation?
  * Are the citations reliable?
  * Does the article tackle one of Wikipedia's equity gaps (coverage of historically
  underrepresented or misrepresented populations or subjects)?
  * Check out the article's Talk page to see what other Wikipedians are already
  contributing. Consider posting some of your ideas to the article's Talk page, too.
