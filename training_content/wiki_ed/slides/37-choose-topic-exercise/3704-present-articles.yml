  Discuss your choices with your instructor. Make sure your selections are
  clearly marked on [this page](/redirect/sandbox/Choose_an_Article?veaction=edit&preload=Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org_choose_article)
  along with your notes to improve the articles. Once you've done so, you're ready to mark
  this exercise "Complete".

  After finalizing your article choice, you should assign that article to yourself. Return to your
  Wiki Education Dashboard course page and add it in the **My Articles** section.

  The next step will be to start compiling a list of relevant and reliable books, journal articles,
  and other sources. You can keep a running list of these sources in your bibliography
  to reference easily when you start writing. Once you've assigned yourself the article, your bibliography
  can be found by going to the **My Articles** section and clicking on the **Bibliography** link underneath
  the article you are working on. Make sure to add your sources there.
