title: Assessing notability
summary:
content: |
  On Wikipedia, a topic is considered article-worthy, or notable, when it has
  received *significant coverage in multiple reliable sources that are independent
  of the subject*.

  * **Significant coverage** means that sources address the subject directly in
    detail. That means more than a trivial mention, but it doesnâ€™t have to be the main
    topic of the source material. The more in-depth the coverage, the fewer
    sources are needed. For sources that cover a topic at length, make sure to
    find at least two. If they provide only a few sentences or a couple paragraphs,
    you'll want to be sure to find more.

  * **Reliable sources** are high-quality publications with a reputation for
    things like accuracy, fact-checking, and editorial oversight. The author,
    publication, and publisher are all relevant to distinguishing reliable from
    unreliable sources. For the purpose of establishing notability, multiple
    sources from the same author or organization are considered a single source.

  * **Independent of the subject** excludes works produced by those affiliated
    with the subject of its creator. For example, press releases, advertising, 
    self-published material by the subject, the subject's website, and autobiographies.
