title: A note on notability
summary:
content: |
  On Wikipedia, a topic is considered article-worthy, or notable, when it has
  mutliple reliable sources covering it.

  A notable topic preferably has 3-5 sources, independent of the subject, and
  with a reputation for fact checking and/or peer review. The mention has to be
  more than just a sentence. A chapter or an entire book is probably enough.

  Notability is particularly important when you're seeking to create a new
  article from scratch.

  These requirements can make it difficult to create articles about rural areas
  of developed countries. And there are challenges to writing biographies or
  histories among underrepresented groups, or many topics about women. Utilizing
  your expertise to gather robust bibliographies for these topics is part of
  the crucial, ongoing process of making Wikipedia's knowledge more equitable.
