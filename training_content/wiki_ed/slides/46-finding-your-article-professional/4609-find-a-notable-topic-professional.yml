title: A note on notability
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia's guidelines for notability rely on existing publications, and so
  reproduce several kinds of systemic biases present in those systems. For
  example, the requirements make it difficult to create articles about subjects
  in parts of the world without a robust publishing infrastructure. It also
  poses challenges to writing about people whose accomplishments have been
  excluded from history books.

  Utilizing your expertise to gather robust bibliographies for underrepresented
  topics is part of the crucial, ongoing process of making Wikipedia's knowledge
  more equitable.
