title: Avoid conflicts of interest (COI)
summary:
content: |
  To make sure Wikipedia publishes neutral content, there are strict [conflict of
  interest rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest).
  That means that as an editor, you cannot edit articles about
  yourself or any subject you have a personal, financial, or professional
  relationship with (coworkers, students, employers, family, companies you've
  invested in, journals you edit for, etc.). Editing in one's area of expertise
  isn't COI, but the COI guidelines can be complicated. If you're not sure if something is COI or not,
  ask Wiki Education staff.

  In that same vein, it's best to avoid citing your own published research when
  editing. Sometimes, however, something you've published may be the best possible
  source to use. In those cases, don't use a lower quality source just to avoid
  conflict of interest. Use your source and be transparent about it by disclosing
  what you've done on the article's Talk page.
