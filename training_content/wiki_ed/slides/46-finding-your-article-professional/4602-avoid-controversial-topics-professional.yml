title: Avoid controversial topics
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia articles on controversial topics are more difficult to edit,
  especially for a new editor.

  While most articles on Wikipedia are easy to simply improve as you see fit, pages deemed
  "controversial" are often watched by people with strong feelings about how
  the article should look or what it should say. That means that sometimes making
  even a small change can require extensive discussion.

  Such an article may reflect a carefully crafted compromise between groups with
  opposing views, and there may have been long discussions in the past about the
  part you want to edit.

  Controversial articles are often highly important sources of public knowledge.
  Approach these topics carefully and patiently, and prepare to engage with other
  editors about your edits.
