  Each WikiProject will have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Eclipses/Assessment_table" target="_blank">an assessment statistics page</a>
  that shows the importance and quality of the articles in that project. The cells are clickable. An
  article of *Mid* or higher importance but *Start* or *Stub* quality might be a
  good one to work on.

  You may also find a topic particularly relevant to your discipline that is rated
  *Low* importance, or unrated. It may still be a good candidate (and it might be
  of higher importance to another WikiProject).
