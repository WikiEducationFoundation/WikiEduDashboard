  The <a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/article_finder">Article Finder</a>
  is another way to find articles to work on. It can be found under
  **My Articles** on your Dashboard course page. Click the "Find Articles" button.

  When you search a keyword, you'll see a list of relevant articles. You can
  filter the results by quality, completeness, and how many page views the
  article receives per day. We recommend finding an article related to your
  topic that is low quality, incomplete, or read by a lot of people. When you've
  discovered an article you want to work on, you can assign the article to yourself
  by selecting the "Assign yourself" button for that particular entry.
