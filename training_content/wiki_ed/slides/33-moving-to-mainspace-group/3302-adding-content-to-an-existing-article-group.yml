title: Adding content to an existing article?
content: |+
  If you're editing an existing article, you need to merge your updated
  content into the article.

  But wait! Have you engaged the article's Talk page with the changes you
  intend to make? There may already be some discussions going on that you
  should consider before adding anything.

  After you've checked the Talk page and you're ready to go, remember:

  -   *Never* copy and paste your draft over the entire article. Instead,
      edit small sections at a time, replacing only content that you've
      changed.
  -   Make many small edits, saving each time, and leaving an edit
      summary. Never replace more than one to two sentences without
      saving! (Leaving edit summaries helps other editors understand what
      you saved. This is good manners!)
