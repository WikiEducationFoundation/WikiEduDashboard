title: Adding content to an existing article?
content: |+
  If you've been working to expand an existing Wikipedia article, you need to
  merge what you wrote into the article.

  But wait! Have you engaged the article's Talk page with the changes you
  intend to make? There may already be some discussions going on that you
  should consider before adding anything.

  After you've checked the Talk page and you're ready to go, remember:

  -   *Never* copy and paste your draft over the entire article. Instead,
      edit small sections at a time, replacing only content that you've
      changed.
  -   Make many small edits, saving each time, and leaving an edit
      summary. Never replace more than one to two sentences without
      saving! (Leaving edit summaries helps other editors understand what
      you changed. This is good manners!)
