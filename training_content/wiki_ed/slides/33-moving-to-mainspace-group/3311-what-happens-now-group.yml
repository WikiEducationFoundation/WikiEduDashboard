title: What happens now?
content: |
  Your page is now living on Wikipedia, where it can be found by anyone
  with an internet connection and a curiosity about what you wrote!

  Other Wikipedians may stop by and give it a look, ask questions, or make
  suggestions. Some might even start making changes.

  Don't panic! This is the Wikipedia process. Everything you've
  contributed will always be accessible to your instructor, so don't worry
  about “protecting” your page from other editors.
