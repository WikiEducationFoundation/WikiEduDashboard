title: Moving a new article out of the sandbox
content: |
  With a good title in mind, you're probably ready to start moving.

  1.  First, do a search of Wikipedia to make sure that there's no article
      covering the topic you've worked on. (It's possible, though
      uncommon, for someone else to create an article with the same name
      while you were drafting yours.) If there is an existing article,
      follow the steps in the earlier slides to merge your content into
      the article.
  2.  Go to the sandbox where your group has been drafting. (Can't
      remember where it is? Check your **Contributions** history in the
      upper right when you're logged in.)
  3.  Do a final review of your work, following the checklist found on
      page 15 of the [Editing
      Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_%28Wiki_Education_Foundation%29_%282017%29.pdf)
      brochure.
  4.  On the sandbox page where your article is, look to the right. To the
      left of your search bar is a tab called “More.” Click it, and then
      click “Move.”

  A new page will appear.
