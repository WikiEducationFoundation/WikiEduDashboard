title: Moving a new article out of the sandbox
content: |
  With a good title in mind, you're ready to move the article live.

  1.  Search Wikipedia via the search bar to make sure there's not already an
      article about your topic. (It's possible, though
      uncommon, for someone else to have created an article with the same name
      while you were drafting yours.) If there is an existing article,
      follow the steps in the earlier slides to merge your content.
  2.  Go to the sandbox where your group has been drafting. (Can't
      remember where it is? Check your **Contributions** history in the
      upper right when you're logged in.)
  3.  Review your article one more time, following the checklist found on
      page 15 of the [Editing
      Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_%28Wiki_Education_Foundation%29_%282017%29.pdf#page=15)
      brochure.
  4.  On your new article's sandbox page, click the "More" tab at the top right,
      next to the search bar. Select "Move" to start the moving process.

  A new page will appear.
