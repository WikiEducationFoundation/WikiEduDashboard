title: Move your page
content: |
  The new page will say “Move page.” In a big window in the center of that
  page (marked “Move page”) you'll be asked for two fields.

  1.  First, to the left, you'll see a box that says “User.” Click and
      change it to “(Article)” This field is the “namespace”. Be sure that
      it says “(Article)” and **not** “Wikipedia”.
  2.  To the right of that, you'll see a box asking for a title. Write out
      your article's title. Pay attention to punctuation and spelling,
      because this can be hard to change once you make it!
  3.  In the “reason” box, enter the reason, something like “I'm moving my
      sandbox article into Wikipedia” will do.
  4.  Review your title one last time, and then click on the gray “Move
      page” button.

  You're done!
