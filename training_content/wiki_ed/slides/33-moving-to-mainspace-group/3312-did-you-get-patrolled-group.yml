title: Did you get "patrolled?"
content: |
  Sometimes new articles, or editors, are marked as “patrolled.” If you
  get this message, don't panic. Though the language sounds a bit severe,
  it's actually a good thing. It means that an experienced Wikipedian has
  come by and checked over your work. Marking the page as “patrolled” lets
  other editors know that you aren't a vandal, or a spam-bot.

  If your page isn't marked as “patrolled,” don't worry, either. It's a
  random process and there are thousands of articles to review, so it may
  not happen quickly, or ever.

  Basically: it's not something you need to worry about either way.
