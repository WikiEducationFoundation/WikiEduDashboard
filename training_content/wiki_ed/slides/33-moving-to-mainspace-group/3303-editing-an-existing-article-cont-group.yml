title: Editing an existing article (cont.)
content: |
  Designate individual group members to move content. Remember, just like
  in your group sandbox, when multiple users edit the same page at once it
  can cause edit conflicts.

  Here's how to move drafted content:

  1.  Open the sandbox where your group has been drafting in Edit mode.
      (References and other templates will break if you copy from Read
      mode.)
  2.  Select the portion you want to move into the live article in
      mainspace.
  3.  Open the original article in Edit mode and add your content into the
      article.
  4.  Add an edit summary that says it copied from your group's sandbox,
      and click 'Publish changes'. (Include a link to that sandbox, like
      `[[User:Your Username/sandbox]]`, in the edit summary.)
  5.  Repeat this process for any other parts of the article you worked
      on.
  6.  Make sure that the lead section reflects the new content you've
      added. And copy-edit the article to ensure that your additions mesh
      well with the older content.

  Once you've gotten the hang of it you can make further edits directly in
  the article, or repeat the sandbox procedure one portion at a time.
