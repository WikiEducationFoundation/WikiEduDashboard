  Professor Ruppel is teaching a class in Federal Indian Law and Policy. She
  includes researching and contributing to Wikipedia as part of the semester goals.


  Professor Ruppel has four course goals. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

  * Critique current issues in Indian Country in legal and historical terms.

  * Analyze Indian legal issues from various perspectives, based on facts â€” not assumptions and stereotypes.

  * Understand the influences and consequences of colonialism for indigenous and non-indigenous people/s.

  * Recognize the relative nature of all legal systems, and apply this to the ideal of a pluralistic society.


  Based on these course goals, graduate students will work together to produce a
  literature review of Federal Indian Law and Policy. As part of the literature
  review, they'll identify major gaps in Wikipedia's content relative to the course goals.


  They will create an annotated bibliography of Federal Indian Law and Policy,
  and an Outline of Federal Indian Law and Policy.
