summary:
content: >
  By week 10, Marguerite's article is fairly complete. Prof. Ruppel reiterates
  neutrality, media fluency, and the impact and limits of Wikipedia. She holds
  an open discussion amongst the class about what the students have done so far
  and why it matters. (You can find good discussion questions in our
  “[Theories: Wikipedia and the production of knowledge](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theories_Wikipedia_and_the_production_of_knowledge.pdf)”
  brochure).


  The Wikipedia Expert offered advice for nominating Marguerite's work
  for *Good Article* status. *Good Article* reviews often produce high quality
  feedback on style and content.
