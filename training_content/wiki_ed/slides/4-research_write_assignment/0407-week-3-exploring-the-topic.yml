title: "Week 3: Exploring the topic area"
summary:
content: >
  In week three, students choose their articles.


  The article a student chooses to work on can make or break the assignment.
  Good candidates for articles are topics with plentiful sources, but weak
  coverage on Wikipedia.


  Marguerite explores improvable articles, and posts the most promising to her
  user page. Prof. Ruppel also worked with a Wikipedia Expert to make a
  list of good articles for her students. Although this took time to prepare,
  her students could research their articles sooner.


  Others let students find articles theyâ€™re interested in. Students get a sense
  of ownership over the material, but it can lead to choices that are further
  afield from course material.
