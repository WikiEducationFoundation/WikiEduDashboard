content: >
  Prof. Ruppel reads through the student contributions and begins marking. Her
  grading isn’t based on the final outcome of the article, because some pages
  were well-researched, but heavily edited by other Wikipedians. Others met the
  course goals, but were deleted from Wikipedia. She anticipated that, and built
  her grading rubric as follows:


  * **20%:** Participation grade (5% each) for assignments from weeks
  1, 2, 3, and 4

  * **10%:** Participation in Wikipedia discussions in class

  * **10%:** Peer reviews and collaboration with classmates

  * **15%:** Presentation and reflective essay

  * **45%:** Quality of main Wikipedia contributions, as described in the
  student’s reflective essay
