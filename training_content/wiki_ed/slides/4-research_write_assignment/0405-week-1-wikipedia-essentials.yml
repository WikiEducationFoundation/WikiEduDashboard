  In week 1, Prof. Ruppel introduces Wikipedia by distributing the
  brochure, â€œ[Editing Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_%28Wiki_Education_Foundation%29_%282017%29.pdf)."
  She also assigned students to complete the one-hour online training.


  Marguerite starts the first module of her student training right away. She does a bit of simple
  research to see what she can find on the subject.


  Students who go through the training have better experiences. The training has
  various steps that students complete throughout the term. We encourage
  attaching a pass/fail metric to up-to-date training in your grading rubric (5%-10% is
  common). You can easily see where students are in their training through the
  Wiki Ed Dashboard, which will highlight upcoming and/or incomplete trainings.
