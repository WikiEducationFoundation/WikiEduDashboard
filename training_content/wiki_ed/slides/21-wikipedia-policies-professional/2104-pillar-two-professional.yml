  **Wikipedia has a neutral point of view.**

  Wikipedia articles should document and explain the major points of view
  in a balanced and impartial manner. Just the facts! Don't:

  -   debate or attempt to persuade readers,
  -   share personal experiences or opinions, or
  -   share your own analysis of the information you find.

  Of course, facts arenâ€™t always clear cut. Some articles might have to
  describe multiple points of view. In those cases, present each view
  accurately, with context.

  Anything you add to an article should be based on a published source of
  information, and you should always cite that information when you
  include it. (We'll cover the mechanisms of adding citations in an
  article later on!).
