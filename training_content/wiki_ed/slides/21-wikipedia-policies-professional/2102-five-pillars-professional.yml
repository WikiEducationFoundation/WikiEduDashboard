  Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, but there's a lot of
  collaboration behind every article. You'll work with many people to
  build Wikipedia. To collaborate effectively, you'll want to follow the
  five key principles, or pillars, of Wikipedia.

  Wikipedia's Five Pillars are:

  -   Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia
  -   Wikipedia has a neutral point of view
  -   Wikipedia is free content
  -   Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner
  -   Wikipedia does not have firm rules

  Letâ€™s explore these a bit.
