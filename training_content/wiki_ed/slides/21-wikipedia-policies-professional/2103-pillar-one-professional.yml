  **Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.**

  OK, maybe this seems obvious. But it may be more helpful to think about
  it as telling you what Wikipedia is NOT.

  It’s not an advertising platform, a personal website, an experiment in
  anarchy or democracy, a collection of random data, or a search engine.

  It’s not a dictionary, a newspaper, a book or instruction manual, or a
  collection of found documents.

  It's an encyclopedia, a place where you can go to find a good summary of
  what's already known about a topic.
