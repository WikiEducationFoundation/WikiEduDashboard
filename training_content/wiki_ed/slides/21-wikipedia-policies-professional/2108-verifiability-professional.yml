  Behind every great Wikipedia article is a collection of great sources.
  Collecting good sources is one of the first things you should be
  thinking about.

  You wouldn’t trust everything you read on the internet, and Wikipedia is
  no different. But at the end of every page, you can see where the facts
  stated in the body of the article came from: its source. That helps
  anyone double check facts to make sure that they’re true. When you add
  content to Wikipedia, you’ll want to give the same opportunity to
  others.

  So, make sure you only share facts that you draw from trustworthy,
  preferably academic sources.

  Some Wikipedia articles have stricter guidelines around sourcing,
  especially when it comes to medical or psychology topics. If you will be
  editing in these areas, take a look at this [training](/training/professional-development/editing-medical-topics-professional)
  to familiarize yourself with these restrictions.
