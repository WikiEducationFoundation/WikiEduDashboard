title: No original research
content: |
  Wikipedia is not a place to publish your own conclusions or theories
  about a topic. On Wikipedia, that’s considered “original research.”

  “No original research” means your writing for Wikipedia will summarize
  what *other* people have said about a topic you’re interested in, so
  that a Wikipedia reader can get an overview of the current thoughts and
  understanding of that topic.

  While it may be tempting to connect ideas in a Wikipedia article, you
  shouldn’t make those connections unless someone else has made them in a
  published, reliable source.
