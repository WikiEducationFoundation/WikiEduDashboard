title: Restoring an earlier version
summary:
content: |
  Sometimes the most expedient way to repair an article is simply
  to undo all the recent changes, reverting the article to an earlier
  version.

  If you've found an earlier version in the article's history that
  you want to restore:

    1. Load that version by clicking its timestamp on the history page

  </figure>

    2. Click 'Edit'. When the editor loads, you should see a message letting
    you know you're editing an old revision.

  </figure>

    3. Click 'Publish changes', add an edit summary to explain why you're
    reverting to an earier version, and then publish it.

  This process will save a new edit under your username, which returns
  the article to its earlier state. You can leave the article like that,
  or make further edits from there.
