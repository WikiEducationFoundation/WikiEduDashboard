title: "The instructor's role in cleaning up bad articles"

  Your expertise is critical when it comes to evaluating the quality of your
  students' work. Ideally, with your feedback students can address major problems
  in their articles before the Wikipedia assignment is over. But if you've
  identified major problems with a student's contributions to a live Wikipedia
  article and it's too late for that, we need your help to fix it.

  While it's not required for you to fix your students' contributions yourself,
  we'd love for you to give it a try. Many instructors do this at the end of
  the term or shortly afterwards. This training module covers the basics of
  how to go about that.

  If you don't plan on fixing major problems that your student(s) introduced
  in an article, please use the "Quality Problems" form to let us
  know what's wrong with it. Our Wiki Experts can use your report to repair
  the article later on, either by fixing the major problems or by removing
  the student contributions. The more details you can provide — especially
  for problems that won't be obvious to a lay reader — the more helpful it
  will be.
