title: Editing the live article
summary:
content: |
  If there is good content among the bad that you want to save, you
  can make whatever edits you wish. If this is your first time editing
  an article, you might want to refer to some of the training modules
  that cover the mechanics of editing Wikipedia pages:

    1. [How to edit: Wikicode vs Visual Editor](/training/students/how-to-edit)
    2. [Adding citations](/training/students/sources)

  Your course's Wiki Expert can help if you have questions, need advice,
  or get stuck with any of the technical aspects of making the changes
  you want.
