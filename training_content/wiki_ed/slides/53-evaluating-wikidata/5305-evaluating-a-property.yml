title: "Evaluating a property"
summary:
content: |
  Wikidata is different from many other linked data repositories in that you can
  contribute to its ontology. If you find that there is a property that doesn't
  express a relationship in a way you think it should, you can start a conversation
  on its discussion page to expand or change its definition.

  If you think there should be a property, but it doesn't exist, you can propose
  one!

  Within property proposals, you can select constraints, data types, and domains to
  better explain how the property works. It is important to remember that Wikidata
  is a collaborative effort. Contributors from many countries with diverse backgrounds
  and areas of expertise all work collaboratively to make Wikidata better. We
  encourage you to collaborate with these editors to understand how to best edit
  and update properties.

  **Remember**: You bring your own expertise to Wikidata. Don't be afraid to
  propose changes. Just make sure you include others in this process.
