  There are a few other methods by which you can evaluate the quality of data on
  Wikidata.

  Wikidata has a **querying** service that you can use to see if items are missing
  properties, values, or other information.

  See what's missing: tools like <a href="https://tabernacle.toolforge.org/#/">TABernacle</a> help you easily identify gaps in
  information by selecting properties to compare in a tabular format (think
  filling in the blanks in a spreadsheet).

  There are several other Wikidata games that invite editors to fill in the
  blanks, enhance descriptions and add non-existent information to items.

  * <a href="https://mix-n-match.toolforge.org/#/">Mix'n'Match</a> - A game
  where users match entities from external databases to Wikidata items
  * <a href="https://wikidata-game.toolforge.org/#">The Wikidata Game</a> -
  Landing page for many different Wikidata "games" that prompt editors to add
  dates, categories, etc.
  * <a href="https://wikidata-game.toolforge.org/distributed/#">The Distributed Game</a> -
  Fill in missing information about items such as what images depict, missing
  birth dates, and items without descriptions
  * <a href="https://wikishootme.toolforge.org/">Wikishootme</a> - A web app 
  that alerts editors when they are near Wikidata items without an image.
  Take a photo, upload it directly to Commons, and the particular Wikidata item
  * <a href="https://wikidata-terminator.toolforge.org/#/">Terminator</a> -
  Items are missing labels, descriptions, and articles in many languages. Help
  change that with this game.

  All of these games are open source, complete with links to code and documentation.
