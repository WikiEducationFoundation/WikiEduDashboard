  Joining discussions about evaluating, expanding or revising how to describe
  things is a great way to get involved on Wikidata. These set ways of describing
  things, referred to on Wikidata as **data models**, present an opportunity for you 
  to share your expertise.

  Wikidata operates on a consensus-driven development process. Having
  conversations about data models on Discussion pages can be just as useful as
  adding new items!
