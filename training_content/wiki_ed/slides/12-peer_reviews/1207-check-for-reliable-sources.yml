title: Reliable sources
summary:
content: |
  Good articles are built on good sources. When you've read the article, turn to
  the references section.

  * Are most statements in the article connected to a reliable source, such as
  textbooks and journal articles? Or do they rely on blogs or self-published authors?
  * Are there a lot of statements attributed to one or two sources? If so, it
  may lead to an unbalanced article, or one that leans too heavily into a single
  point of view.
  * Are there any unsourced statements in the article, or statements that you
  can't find stated in the references? Just because there is a source listed,
  doesn't mean it's presented accurately!
