title: Follow their lead
summary:
content: |
  The lead is the first section of an article. It usually states the most
  important information about the article's subject, and gives a good overview
  of the rest of the article.

  Good leads don't get too bogged down in detail, and don't simply repeat what's
  in the article below. You should be able to read the lead and feel like you
  have a pretty good grasp of what the article is about.

  Ask yourself:
  * Looking at the lead by itself, do I feel satisfied that I know the
  importance of the topic?
  * Looking at the lead again after reading the rest of the article, does the
  lead reflect the most important information?
  * Does the lead give more weight to certain parts of the article over others?
  Is anything missing? Is anything redundant?
