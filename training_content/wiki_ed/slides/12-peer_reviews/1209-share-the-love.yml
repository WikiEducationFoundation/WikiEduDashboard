  Many students consider peer review to be difficult, because they don't want to
  criticize a classmate's work. Remember that critiquing doesn't equal
  criticism. That's why it's helpful to post your comments as useful ideas.

  For example, instead of suggesting an editor is biased one way or another,
  focus on the content within the article that suggests a bias. In the end, you
  aren't criticizing your classmate, you are evaluating the article.

  Consider the following structure, drawing from your notes:

  1. First, what does the article do well? Is there anything from your review
  that impressed you? Any turn of phrase that described the subject in a clear
  way?
  2. What changes would you suggest the author apply to the article? Why would
  those changes be an improvement?
  3. What's the most important thing the author could do to improve the article?
  4. Did you notice anything about the article you reviewed that could be
  applicable to your own article? Let them know!
