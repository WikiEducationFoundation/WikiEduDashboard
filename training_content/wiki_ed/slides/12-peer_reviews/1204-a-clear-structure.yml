  Now, let's look at the article itself. Different aspects of the article should
  each have their own section. The difference between sections should be easy to
  understand, and each statement should have a clear reason for being where it
  is.

  Ask yourself:
  * Are the sections organized well, in a sensible order? Would they make more
  sense presented some other way (chronologically, for example)?
