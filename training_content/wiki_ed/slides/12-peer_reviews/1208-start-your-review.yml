title: "Leave a message"
summary:
content: |
  When you have reviewed your peer's article, you should leave a message on
  their User Talk page (unless your instructor encourages you to do it some
  other way). Leaving a message on a User Talk page is different than leaving one on the
  Talk page of their sandbox (remember that ''every'' page on Wikipedia has a
  Talk page), and will notify them (whereas, leaving a note on their sandbox
  will not).

  To find a user's Talk page, go to their Wikipedia User page — something like
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:HistoryBuff34". You'll see the Talk link
  at the top left of the page. Click "New Section" on the Talk page and enter
  your message. Remember to sign with four tildes! (~~~~)
