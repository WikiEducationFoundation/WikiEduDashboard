title: Start your review

content: |
  When you have reviewed your classmate's article, you should leave a message on
  their User Talk page (unless your instructor encourages you to do it some
  other way). Leaving a message on a User Talk page is different than leaving one on the
  Talk page of their sandbox (remember that ''every'' page on Wikipedia has a
  Talk page), and will notify them (whereas, leaving a note on their sandbox
  will not).

  To find a user's Talk page, go to the **Students** tab on the Dashboard and
  click on their username. You'll see the Talk link at the top left of the page.
  Click "New Section" on the Talk page and enter your message. Remember to sign
  with four tildes! (~~~~)
