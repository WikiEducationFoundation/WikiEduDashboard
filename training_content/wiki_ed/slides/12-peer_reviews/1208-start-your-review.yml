  When you have reviewed your classmate's article, you should leave a message on
  their User Talk page (unless your instructor encourages you to do it some
  other way).

  To find a user's Talk page, click on their username and you'll see the talk
  link at the top left of the page. To create a new section, click "New section" on the
  Talk page.
