title: Neutral content
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia articles aim for a neutral point of view. That means they don't
  attempt to persuade the reader into accepting a particular idea or position.

  * Do you think you could guess the perspective of the author by reading the article?
  * Are there any words or phrases that don't feel neutral? For example, "the
  best idea," "most people," or negative associations, such as "While it's
  obvious that x, some insist that y."
  * Does the article make claims on behalf of unnamed groups or people? For
  example, "some people say..."
  * Does the article focus too much on negative or positive information?
  Remember, neutral doesn't mean "the best positive light" or "the worst, most
  critical light." It means a clear reflection of various aspects of a topic.
