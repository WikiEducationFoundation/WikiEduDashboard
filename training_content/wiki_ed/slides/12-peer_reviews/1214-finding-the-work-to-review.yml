  ## Reviewing sandbox drafts

  If your class has been drafting in sandboxes and has not yet moved the work to live artices,
  you can use the 'Sandbox Draft' link for your assigned review in My Articles
  to find your classmate's draft that you'll be reviewing.

  If that classmate's draft hasn't been posted yet, you may see the message "Wikipedia does not have a user
  page with this exact name" instead. In that case, contact your classmate to find out if
  they've posted their work somewhere else.

  ## Reviewing live articles
  
  If your class is already working on live artices, you will be reviewing the the current version of the article
  you classmate is working on. Use the 'Article' link for your assigned review in My Articles to see the live article.
