  Once you've figured out where to leave your peer review, the next step is to
  determine what makes a good article.

  In general, the best Wikipedia articles have five elements:
  * A lead section that is easy to understand
  * A clear structure
  * Balanced coverage
  * Neutral content
  * Reliable sources

  As you go through the review process, make note of what the article
