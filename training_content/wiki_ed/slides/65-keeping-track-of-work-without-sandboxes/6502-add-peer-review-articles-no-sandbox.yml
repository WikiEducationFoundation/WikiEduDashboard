summary:
content: |
  Click **Review an article** to see the topics your classmates are working on and choose
  which ones you will peer review.

  When you select a classmate's article to review, the listing will include links to their
  bibliography, a link to the page where you should complete your peer review,
  and a link to the current version of the article (if it's already live on Wikipedia),
  which is what you will be reviewing.
