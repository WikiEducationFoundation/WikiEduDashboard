  You can see the details for each stage of the article development process by clicking the bar
  at the bottom of the article listing. For the first stage, compiling your set of sources,
  use the **Bibliography** link. This will open a wiki sandbox page that includes some basic
  structure to get you started.

  Follow the trainings link to review the training modules related to this stage of the assignment.

  Once you've compiled your initial bibliography, click **Mark Complete** to go to the next stage.
  Keeping track of which step you're on will make it easier for your instructor and your peer reviewers
  to know when your work is ready for review.
