title: Sandboxes (continued)
content: |
  If you're enrolled in a Fellows cohort on this Dashboard, then your
  sandbox page was automatically set up.

  You'll see a section at the top — a *template* — that says “this is a
  user sandbox”. In source editing mode, you can see the Wikicode for that
  template, something like `{{dashboard.wikiedu.org sandbox}}`. That's a
  good thing to leave there.

  In the next training, you'll learn how to edit in [your
  sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox).
