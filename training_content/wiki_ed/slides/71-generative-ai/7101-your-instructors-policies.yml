title: "Follow your instructor's policies"
content: |
  Before you consider using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for your work on Wikipedia (or any assignment!),
  **always defer to the policies of your instructor**. Unsure of your instructor’s policies? Be sure to ask them!

  Remember, your college or university’s library is always an important resource. While this training module
  offers suggestions for using generative AI to do research, your university’s library or writing center may offer better
  support. We encourage you to visit the library on campus for more information or connect with your librarians
  online.

  In this training module, we’ll explore ways other editors have found generative AI tools helpful in their
  work to improve Wikipedia. Only consider these ideas if both your institution and your course instructor
  allow students to use AI when completing coursework.
