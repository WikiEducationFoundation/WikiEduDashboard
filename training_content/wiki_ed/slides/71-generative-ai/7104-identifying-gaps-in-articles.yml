title: A word of caution
content: |
  Have you read through your Wikipedia article, researched the topic thoroughly,
  and believe you have identified all information gaps in the article’s coverage
  of the topic? If you feel confident that you’ve found all of the gaps, you can
  ask a generative AI tool if it can find anything else that is missing from the
  article, just in case.

  Then, use your own knowledge of the topic from your research to decide if the
  AI tool correctly identified any additional gaps. It might not, so be sure to
  use your own critical thinking skills!
