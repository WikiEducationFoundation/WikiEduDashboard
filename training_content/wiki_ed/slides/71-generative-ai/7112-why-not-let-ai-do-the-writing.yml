title: Why not let AI do the writing?
content: |
  Generative AI tools do a poor job writing about things missing from Wikipedia,
  because their own knowledge is largely based on whatâ€™s already on Wikipedia.
  In fact, sometimes an AI tool may suggest adding content to Wikipedia even
  when there are no sources to support that information. Your ability to
  evaluate sources, review them carefully, and synthesize the information they
  provide is essential to improving the encyclopedia. 

  Remember, anything you add to Wikipedia will be attributed to your username
  and will live in the history tab of the article forever. Readers will assume
  you wrote everything yourself and you have fully verified your sources, which
  is critical to everyone who visits Wikipedia looking for reliable information.
