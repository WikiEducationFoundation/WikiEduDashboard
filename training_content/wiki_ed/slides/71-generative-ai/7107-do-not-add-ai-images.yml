title: Do NOT add images generated by AI
content: |
  Finding copyright-free images to add to Wikipedia can be tricky — that’s
  why we recommend you only upload photos that you took yourself.

  ***Images generated by AI must NOT be added to Wikipedia.*** Wikipedia is an
  encyclopedia, and readers expect its images to accurately reflect reality.
  Illustrations must be factual and representational — grounded in verifiable,
  real-world subjects — not artificially generated or imagined. AI-generated
  images do not meet this standard.
