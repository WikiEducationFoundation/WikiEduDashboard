title: Do NOT add images generated by AI
content: |
  Finding copyright-free images to add to Wikipedia can be tricky – that’s why we
  recommend you only upload photos that you took yourself.

  Images generated by AI should NOT be added to Wikipedia. You can explore the
  very few [exceptions to this policy here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Image_use_policy#AI-generated_images).

  *As you work through your Wikipedia assignment, keep in mind the ways generative
  AI tools can be both helpful and harmful. And remember, always defer to the AI
  policies of your institution and instructor.*
