title: Why not let AI do the writing?
content: |
  You may already use AI tools like Grammarly to suggest edits
  for your writing. Please **do NOT use Grammarly or other AI tools
  to copy edit** your work in any part of the Wikipedia assignment,
  including exercises and contributions to articles.

  Why not? The same reasons you shouldn’t use AI to draft text also
  apply to copyediting. AI tools like Grammarly are designed to
  polish up text grammatically, but in doing so, they may introduce
  errors. (They don’t try to make the text accurate, they try to
  make it look good!)

  If you use Grammarly, please toggle off the “Check for writing
  suggestions” in your Grammarly settings while working on your
  Wikipedia assignment (including exercises), or simply ignore
  any suggestions that appear.

  Now that we know why AI-generated or AI-edited text should NOT
  be pasted into Wikipedia, let’s look at other ways AI tools can
  be used carefully and intentionally to help improve Wikipedia.
