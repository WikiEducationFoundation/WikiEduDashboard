title: Why not let AI do the copyediting?
content: |
  You may already use AI tools like Grammarly to suggest edits
  for your writing. Please **do NOT use Grammarly or other AI tools
  to copy edit** your work in any part of the Wikipedia assignment,
  including exercises and contributions to articles.

  Why not? The same reasons you shouldn’t use AI to draft text also
  apply to copyediting. AI tools like Grammarly are designed to
  polish up text grammatically, but in doing so, they may introduce
  errors. (They don’t try to make the text accurate, they try to
  make it look good!)

  If you use Grammarly, it can be useful for identifying areas
  for improvement or correcting outright grammatical errors, but suggestions
  beyond simple spelling and grammar fixes very often
  change the intended meaning (and also make it harder for AI detectors
  to distinguish your writing from AI-generated text).

  Similarly, you should not use ChatGPT or similar tools to copyedit
  your Wikipedia content (although it's fine to help you identify
  problems).

  Now that we know why AI-generated or AI-edited text should NOT
  be pasted into Wikipedia, let’s look at other ways AI tools can
  be used carefully and intentionally to help improve Wikipedia.
