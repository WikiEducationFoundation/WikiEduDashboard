title: "Generative AI as a tool: Harm vs. help"
content: |
  Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are tools. Like any tools, they can be harmful or
  helpful, depending on how we use them.

  Have you ever searched for something online, read the AI summary of the topic, and
  realized it wasn’t quite right? Maybe it left out a significant piece of information
  or simply made something up.

  Inaccurate, missing, or misleading information can be damaging, especially when we
  use it to make decisions. So, it’s incredibly important to be cautious if you use
  generative AI during your work to improve Wikipedia.
