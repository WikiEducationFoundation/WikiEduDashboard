title: "Generative AI as a tool: Harm vs. help"
content: |
  Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are tools. Like many tools, they can be harmful or
  helpful, depending on how we use them.

  Have you ever searched for something online, read the AI summary of the topic, and realized
  it wasn’t quite right? Maybe it left out a significant piece of information or simply
  made something up.

  Inaccurate, missing, or misleading information can be damaging to readers, especially
  when we use it to make decisions. So, it’s incredibly important to be cautious if you
  use generative AI during your work to improve Wikipedia.
