title: "Generative AI as a tool: Harm vs. help"
content: |
  Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are tools. Like any tools, they can be harmful or
  helpful, depending on how we use them.

  Have you ever searched for something online, read the AI summary of the topic, and
  realized it wasn’t quite right? Maybe it left out a significant piece of information
  or simply made something up.

  Inaccurate, missing, or misleading information can be damaging, especially when we
  use it to make decisions. It’s incredibly important to be cautious if you use
  generative AI in any way during your work to improve Wikipedia, because real people rely
  on the accuracy of Wikipedia's text to form opinions and make decisions. What you do
  on Wikipedia can impact people in the real world, which means your Wikipedia assignment
  is so much more than a course project.

  **Don’t ask an AI tool to write or copy edit any text you paste into Wikipedia. This
  includes all exercises throughout your Wikipedia assignment, such as *Evaluating Wikipedia*,
  *Find potential articles*, and *Outline proposed changes*.** Make sure any text you add
  to Wikipedia is your _own best_ work!
