content: |
  This training module is a work in progress. Let us know what you thought about it! 

  Is there something AI-related that you hoped to find an answer to that was missing?
  Are there ways of using AI that you've found especially relevant for Wikipedia
  writing? Cautionary tales of the risks of using AI content? Anything else you think
  future students ought to know when it comes to AI and Wikipedia? Anecdotes about
  how you've used it or seen others using it?
  
  **Your feedback is really appreciated!**
