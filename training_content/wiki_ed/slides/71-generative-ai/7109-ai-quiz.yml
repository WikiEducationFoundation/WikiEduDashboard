        Ask an AI tool to write a new paragraph for a specific
        Wikipedia article using high-quality sources it finds online.
      explanation:
        INCORRECT. Generative AI tools can fabricate “facts” and
        hallucinate “sources” – and adding text written by AI could
        get you blocked as an editor!

        Ask an AI tool to see if there are any facts that
        lack citations in the text you’ve written for Wikipedia.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT. Using an AI tool to review your writing and
        identify any problem areas can be helpful.

        If a Wikipedia article doesn’t include an image and you can’t
        find a copyright-free photo or illustration, ask a generative
        AI tool to create an image so you can fill this gap.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. Do _not_ add images generated by AI to Wikipedia.
        There are [very few exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Image_use_policy#AI-generated_images) to this policy.

        Before you start your own research on the topic, ask
        an AI tool to find any information gaps in the Wikipedia article
        you want to improve.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT: Using an AI tool to search for gaps can be helpful, but
        only _after_ you have researched the topic thoroughly yourself and are
        confident you know what’s missing from the article – you can ask
        the AI tool to double check for you, just in case!
