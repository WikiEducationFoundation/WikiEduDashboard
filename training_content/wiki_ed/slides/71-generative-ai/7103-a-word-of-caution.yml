title: "A word of caution: Do NOT use AI to write text for Wikipedia"
content: |
  Again, to be clear — do NOT ask an AI chatbot to write your Wikipedia article
  for you or use AI output during your Wikipedia assignment exercises. Never
  paste output from an AI tool into a Wikipedia article or on sandbox pages
  during your earlier exercises.

  Wikipedia editors will delete any content you add to Wikipedia that they suspect
  was written by AI. This includes content written with the help of editing tools
  like Grammarly. If you paste AI-assisted content into Wikipedia, you are wasting
  the time of Wikipedia volunteers. Repeated violations of this rule can lead to
  you being blocked from editing.

  Why is this so critical? Generative AI tools can fabricate “facts” and hallucinate
  “sources” — and adding fake content to Wikipedia will make it worse for everyone,
  not better. Let’s explore these real-world reasons a bit more.
