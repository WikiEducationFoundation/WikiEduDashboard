title: "A word of caution: Do NOT use AI to write text for Wikipedia"
content: |
  Again, to be clear — do NOT ask an AI chatbot to write your Wikipedia article
  for you or use AI output during your Wikipedia assignment exercises. Never
  paste output from an AI tool into a Wikipedia article or on sandbox pages
  during your earlier exercises.

  Using AI to generate new text for a Wikipedia article is one of the fastest ways to
  get everything you added deleted! Volunteer editors in the Wikipedia community are on
  the look out for anything they suspect was written by AI.

  Why is this so critical? Generative AI tools can fabricate “facts” and hallucinate
  “sources” — and adding fake content to Wikipedia will make it worse for everyone,
  not better. Let’s explore these real-world reasons a bit more.
