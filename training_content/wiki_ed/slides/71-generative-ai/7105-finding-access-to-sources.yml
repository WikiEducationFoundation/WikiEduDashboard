title: Finding access to sources
content: |
  Perhaps you’ve found a reference to a source that seems like a great addition to a
  Wikipedia article, but you can’t find access to the source to actually read it.
  Try asking a generative AI tool if it can locate an access point to the source.

  Think you’ve found all of the available sources related to the article you’re
  editing? Ask a generative AI tool if there are other sources you should read
  and consider citing in the article. But remember, be sure to double check that
  all sources you use meet Wikipedia’s
  [source policy](/training/students/evaluating-articles/what-is-a-good-source).
