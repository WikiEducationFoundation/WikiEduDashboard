title: 'How to respond to "Suspected AI edit" emails'
content: |
  If get an email about a "Suspected AI edit", it will
  include a link to the Pangram report. This report shows
  exactly what text was analyzed, which sections
  were flagged as likely AI-generated, which sections were
  marked as fully human, and which sections were somewhere
  in-between.

  Have a look at the report, then **fill out the follow-up
  questionnaire before you continue editing Wikipedia**.
  (Your response will only be avaible to Wiki Education staff.)
  If you used copyediting tools that may have
  contributed to the edit getting flagged as AI, provide as
  much detail as you can about what tools you used, how you
  used them, and which options were enabled. This information
  will help Wiki Education refine our detection system and
  make it more reliable for catching bad edits without flagging
  good ones.

  If you did use AI to generate some or all of the content that
  was flagged, you should edit that page to remove it as soon
  as possible. While AI-generated text is not a problem in-and-of
  itself, encyclopedia content from AI is almost always unverifiable
  and doesn't match up to the cited sources, so it's not acceptable
  for Wikipedia.
