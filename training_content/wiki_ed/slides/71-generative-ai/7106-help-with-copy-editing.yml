title: Help with copy editing
content: |
  After you collect sources and use them to write new text for a Wikipedia article,
  you could consider using an AI tool as a copy editor. Ask the tool to help pinpoint
  any potential problem areas in your writing, including:

  * grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors
  * sentences that are not written in a neutral, encyclopedic style
  * facts that are missing a citation
