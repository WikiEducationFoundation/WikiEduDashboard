title: "Follow your institution’s policies"
content: |
  Before you consider using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for your work on Wikipedia (or any assignment!),
  **always defer to the policies of your institution and instructor**. Unsure of the policies that apply to you?
  Be sure to ask your instructor.

  In this training module, we’ll explore ways other editors have found generative AI tools helpful in their
  work to improve Wikipedia. Only consider these ideas if both your institution and your course instructor
  allow students to use AI when completing coursework.
