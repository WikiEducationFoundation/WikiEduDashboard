  The basic requirement for a topic to have its own article is:
  *significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the
  subject.*

  -   **Significant coverage** is more than a trivial mention, though it
      doesn’t have to be the core focus of the book or article you cite.
      On the other hand, it should be more than a single mention or single
      line of text.
  -   **Reliable sources** generally means that coverage comes from
      secondary sources from reputable publishers. The book, journal
      article, or other sources you reference should have a reputation for
      accuracy and fact-checking. Those sources don’t have to be in
      English, and they don’t have to be online.
  -   **Independent of the subject** means the publisher doesn't have a
      stake in presenting a biased point of view (either positive or
      negative). For example, self-publicity, advertising, self-published
      material by the subject of your article, autobiographies, and press
      releases are not considered independent.
