title: Name your article
content: |+
  Before you move your sandbox article to Wikipedia's mainspace, let's
  give it a name.

  Look at similar topics and choose a title that matches theirs. Your
  article title shouldn't be a question or even a sentence. The best title
  is usually the simplest statement of what your article is about!

  -   Use natural English
  -   Capitalize only the first letter (and proper nouns)
  -   Use blank spaces between words
  -   Don't omit words
