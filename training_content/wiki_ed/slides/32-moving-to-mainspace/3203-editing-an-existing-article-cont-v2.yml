title: Editing an existing article (cont.)
content: |
  Here's how to move your drafted content:

  1.  Open your sandbox in Edit mode. (References and other templates will
      break if you copy from Read mode.)
  2.  If you added bold formatting to differentiate your additions from
      existing content, remove it now.
  3.  Select the portion you want to move into the live article.
  4.  Open the original article in Edit mode and add your content into the
      article.
  5.  Add an edit summary that says it was copied from your sandbox, and
      click 'Publish changes'. (Include a link to your sandbox, like
      `[[User:Your Username/sandbox]]`, in the edit summary.)
  6.  Repeat this process for any other parts of the article you worked
      on.
  7.  Make sure that the lead section reflects the new content you've
      added. And copy-edit the article to ensure your additions mesh
      well with the preexisting content.

  Once you've gotten the hang of it, you can make additional changes directly in
  the article, or repeat the sandbox procedure each time you add new content.
