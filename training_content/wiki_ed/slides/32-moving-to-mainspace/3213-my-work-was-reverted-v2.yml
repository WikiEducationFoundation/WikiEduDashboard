title: My work was reverted!

  Stay calm! Remember, your instructor has access to your work
  *regardless* of whether it stays on Wikipedia.

  If your work is reverted by another editor, it is your responsibility to
  open a dialogue with that editor about why the work was removed.

  Do not add anything back until you understand why it was removed and how
  you can fix it. If you *do* add reverted work back without going through
  these steps, it will be seen as an edit war and your account could be
  blocked from editing Wikipedia.
