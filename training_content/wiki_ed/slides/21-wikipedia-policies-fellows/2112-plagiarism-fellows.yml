  Plagiarism on Wikipedia encompasses copy-and-paste plagiarism, close
  paraphrasing of another text, and unattributed quotations. Copyright
  violations are also heavily monitored and flagged.

  Plagiarism and copyright violations are disruptive and time-consuming
  for volunteers to clean up. Except for brief quotations, copying content
  from copyrighted sources onto Wikipedia is against policy.

  Wikipediaâ€™s primary concern is with copyright violations, since it
  creates legal liability for the site. These violations most often take
  the form of image uploads to Wikipedia's sister site, [Wikimedia
  Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), which are then
  used to illustrate articles.
