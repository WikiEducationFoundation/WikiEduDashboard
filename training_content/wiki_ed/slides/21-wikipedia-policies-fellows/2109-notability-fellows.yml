title: Notability
content: |
  Wikipedia isn’t a catalog of everything that’s ever existed. Some topics
  and articles don't exist on Wikipedia because the subject hasn’t been
  covered enough by outside sources. In other words, it isn’t yet notable.

  If you decide to create a new Wikipedia article, you might be asked why
  this topic is notable enough to remain on the site. Find a handful of
  reliable sources early, so you know your article is notable. Then you
  can share them through the article’s Talk page as you get started.
  (We’ll show you how to do this later on).
