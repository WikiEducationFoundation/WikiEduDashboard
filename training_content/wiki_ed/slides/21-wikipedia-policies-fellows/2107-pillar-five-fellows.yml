  **Wikipedia does not have firm rules.**

  OK, we know you just read a bunch of rules. So what does this last one
  mean?

  Rules in Wikipedia are not carved in stone. Their wording and
  interpretation are likely to change over time.

  The principles and spirit of Wikipedia's rules matter more than their
  literal wording, and sometimes improving Wikipedia requires making an
  exception to a rule.

  Be bold (but not reckless) in updating articles. Dive in, and don’t
  panic about making mistakes. Prior versions of pages are saved, so
  mistakes can be corrected. The most important thing to do is communicate
  through Talk pages — the part of every article where Wikipedians discuss
  what they're working on — to tell the other editors what you’d like to
  do, what you’ve done, and why.

  Think of it this way: **You aren’t going to break Wikipedia (but please
  don’t try).**

  Wikipedia editing is about using your best judgment, and you may be
  asked to explain your decisions.

  Let’s look at a few more core policies that will help you make a
  meaningful contribution to Wikipedia.
