title: Assessing notability
summary:
content: |
  The basic requirement for a topic to have its own article is: *significant
  coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject*. Here's a
  little more detail about how this rule is interpreted by Wikipedians:

  * **Significant coverage** means that sources address the subject directly in
    detail. Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, but doesn’t have to be
    the main topic of the source material. On the other hand, a single-line
    mention in a text would be non-significant.

  * **Reliable sources**, for the sake of establishing notability, generally
    means at least two independent secondary sources from reputable publishers
    with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. These don’t need to be in
    English, or available online. Multiple sources from the same author or
    organization are considered a single source for establishing notability.

  * **Independent of the subject** excludes works produced by those affiliated
    with the subject or its creator. For example, self-publicity, advertising,
    self-published material by the subject, the subject's website,
    autobiographies, and press releases are not considered independent.
