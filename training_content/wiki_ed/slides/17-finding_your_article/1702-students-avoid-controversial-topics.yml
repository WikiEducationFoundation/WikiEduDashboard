title: Avoid controversial topics
summary:
content: |
  Controversial topics are best avoided. These articles will often have a
  "locked" icon on the top right: <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Padlock-blue.svg/20px-Padlock-blue.svg.png" />.

  On these pages, you'll find editors with strong feelings about how the article
  should look, and what it should say.

  Controversial articles may also be an already carefully crafted compromise
  between groups with opposing views.

  Take a look at Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_controversial_issues" target="_blank">list of controversial issues</a>
  for an idea about what to avoid.
