  > "Subject isn't notable."

  Unfortunately, *notability* is a pretty ambiguous term. It may sound like a
  value judgment on the importance of that topic.

  On Wikipedia, though, a notable topic is one that has a lot of reliable
  sources covering it. When a topic isn't notable, it means that there's not
  enough written about it to cite on a Wikipedia article.

  A notable topic preferably has 3-5 sources, independent of the subject (think
  back to the conflict of interest slide!), and with a reputation for fact
  checking and/or peer review. The mention has to be more than just a sentence.
  A chapter or an entire book is probably enough.

  Notability is particularly important when you're seeking to create a new
  article from scratch.

  These requirements can make it difficult to create articles about rural areas
  of developed countries. And there are challenges to writing biographies or
  histories among underrepresented groups, or many topics about women.

  However, with the assistance of a bibliography and your own expertise, you
  might be able to connect good sources to an unwritten topic. If so, that
  contribution is part of the crucial, ongoing process of expanding Wikipedia's
  coverage in these areas.
