  categories at the bottom of every article.

  Try going to an article related to the subject of your class. Scroll to the
  very end to find a list of categories. Choose one, and you'll see a list of
  subcategories and related articles.

  Scanning through these categories can be a quick way to find interesting
  articles. And as you skim through an article, you can start to think about
  what could be added or improved.

  Categories also offer a good idea of articles you might want to create. What
  important topics are missing?

  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_disciplines" target="_blank">"Academic disciplines" category</a>
  is a great place to explore and start brainstorming.
