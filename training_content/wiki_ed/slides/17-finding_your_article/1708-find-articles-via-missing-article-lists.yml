title: Using a missing articles list
summary:
content: |
  There are also lists of *missing* articles on Wikipedia. But these should be
  approached with some caution.

  Many of these lists haven't been screened for viability. That is to say, while
  these topics may be important, they're not necessarily ready to exist as
  articles on Wikipedia.

  WikiProject Women scientists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_scientists/Worklist" target="_blank">curates a list of missing articles</a>,
  but this is rare. In most WikiProjects you'd have to find these content gaps
  on your own.

  Sometimes articles are missing for a reason. Very often, that reason is that
  they don't have enough reliable sources to stand alone as an article.

  For Wikipedia, topics must be "notable." Let's look at what Wikipedia means by
  that.
