  The <a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/article_finder">Article Finder</a>
  is another way to find articles to work on. The tool can be found on the
  **Articles** tab of your Dashboard course page, by pressing the
  "Available Articles" button. Once there, click the "Find Articles" button located
  at the top right of the page.

  When you search a keyword, you'll see a list of relevant articles. You can
  filter the results by quality, completeness, and how many page views the article
  receives per day. We recommend finding an article related to your topic that
  is low quality, incomplete, or read by a lot of people.
