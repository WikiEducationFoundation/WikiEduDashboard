  The <a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/article_finder">Article Finder</a>
  is another way to find articles to work on. The tool can be launched from the
  **My Articles** section of your Dashboard course page, by clicking the "Find Articles" button.

  When you search a keyword, you'll see a list of relevant articles. You can
  filter the results by quality, completeness, and how many page views the article
  receives per day. We recommend finding an article related to your topic that
  is low quality, incomplete, or read by a lot of people.
