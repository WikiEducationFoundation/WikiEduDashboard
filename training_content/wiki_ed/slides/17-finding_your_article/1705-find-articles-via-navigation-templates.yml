title: Using navigation templates to find content gaps
summary:
content: |
  Sometimes articles have navigation templates, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_Angola" target="_blank">this one</a>
  shown below. Usually found at the bottom of an article, they give a quick
  overview of a category and may also highlight missing articles.

      Navigation templates may be collapsed by default. Click 'show' to expand them.

  The red links you see are articles that don't exist, but should! These red
  links can also be seen in the body of an article, not just the navigation
  template.
