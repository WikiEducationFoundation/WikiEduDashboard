title: Avoid conflicts of interest (COI)
summary:
content: |
  To make sure that Wikipedia continues to publish neutral content, there are
  strict conflict of interest rules. As a student, you are dependent on your
  instructor for a grade. So you might be seen to have a conflict of interest if
  you:

  * Work on articles about your instructor
  * Work on articles about people closely connected to your instructor (such as
  postdocs working for them)
  * Write an article about the department or program from which you intend to
  earn your degree
  * Cite your instructor's publications in the articles you're working on much
  more heavily than you do other sources. (It's OK to cite your instructor's
  work as one part of a wide variety of high quality sources.)

  If you're unsure if a topic is acceptable, simply ask the Wikipedia Expert
  assigned to your class for guidance.

  Now, let's look at the exciting part: finding the ideal article to improve!
