  picking a topic that needs *improvement*.

  The best articles on Wikipedia are the worst articles to work on.

  or a green circle (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/19px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png" />)

  Wikipedia community. This means they meet a pretty high standard of writing,
  come from a reliable set of sources, and have gone through a strict approval
  process.

  Simply put, working on a good or featured article will present you with many
  more hurdles than working on a less detailed article. If you're new to editing
  Wikipedia, these hurdles can be especially frustrating.
