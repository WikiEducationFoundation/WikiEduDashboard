  The Wikipedia Expert assigned to your course knows Wikipedia inside and out.
  Literally. They know what goes on behind the scenes, where knowledge is
  produced by Wikipedians. They also know how to create and format articles.

  If you need help determining good subjects for articles, or if you have a
  question about sources or topics, you should connect with them through the
  *Get Help* button on the top right corner of your course page.
