title: Using WikiProjects
summary:
content: |
  Many topics on Wikipedia belong to a WikiProject. That's a group of volunteer
  Wikipedians who focus on improving coverage of a certain category of articles.

  You can find relevant WikiProjects by going to an article in the field you're
  interested in and clicking over to the Talk page tab. You'll see a box at the
  top of the page describing which WikiProjects are interested in this article.
  Click through to find the page for the WikiProject.

  On the WikiProject page, you should find an assessment table. These are
  designed to help WikiProject members find articles to improve. In the next
  slide, we'll show you one, and how to read it.
