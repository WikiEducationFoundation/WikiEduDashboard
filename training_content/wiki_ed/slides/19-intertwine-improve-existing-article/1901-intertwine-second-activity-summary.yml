  You will meet with students enrolled in other Wiki Education courses through a video conference using Intertwine (more about this next page!) 

  Together with them, you will pick a Wikipedia article to work on for an hour. You will first evaluate what is good or needs improvement in the article, and then make small edits as necessary (e.g., fix citations). At the end of the session, you will communicate your thoughts as a group on the article’s Talk Page. Most people who complete this module think it’s fun!

  Don’t worry if you are not familiar with some of the Wiki terminology now -- we have included detailed instructions in the session to ensure the best outcomes, and you will of course exchange help with peers.
