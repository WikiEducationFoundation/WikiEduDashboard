  You will meet with students enrolled in other Wiki Education courses in a video conference using Intertwine collaborative software (For information on the software, check out our <a href="https://mentorhub-app.herokuapp.com/faq-contact">FAQ</a>!)

  Together with them, you will pick a Wikipedia article to work on for an hour. You will first evaluate what is good or needs to be improved in the article, and then make small edits as necessary (e.g., fix citations). At the end of the session, you will communicate your thoughts as a group on the article’s Talk Page. People who complete this module think it’s fun!

  Don’t worry if you are not familiar with some of the Wiki terminology now -- we have included detailed instructions in the session to ensure the best outcomes, and you will of course exchange help with peers.
