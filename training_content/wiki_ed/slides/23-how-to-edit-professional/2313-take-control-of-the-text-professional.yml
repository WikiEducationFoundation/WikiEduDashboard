title: Take control of the text!
content: |
  Most of the time you'll use the Visual Editor, but if you want to edit a
  Talk page (found at the upper-left of every Wikipedia article) or make
  changes in source editing mode, you'll need to learn a little Wikicode.

  The wiki code for **bold** text is like this:

  `'''bold'''` = **bold**

  Creating a wikilink (that is, a link to another article on Wikipedia)
  looks like this:

  `[[bold]]` = [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold)

  On the English Wikipedia, that link to the article
  [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness) will redirect you to
  [Emphasis
  (typography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_%28typography%29).
  To link to an article with a different name than the
  text, put a `|` (a “pipe”, inserted with ''shift + '' on most keyboards)
  in between the code and the word you want to appear on the page. Like
  this:

  `[[boldness|bold]]` = [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness)
  (with the link to [Boldness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness))
