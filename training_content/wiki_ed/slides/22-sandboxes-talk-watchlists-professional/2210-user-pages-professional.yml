  Everyone with a Wikipedia account has a User page. And all User pages have
  their own Talk pages. This is where you can engage directly with a particular
  editor. They will be notified if you leave a message for them on their
  personal Talk page.

  Your User page can be found in the upper right menu bar on Wikipedia whenever
  you're logged in.

  Open Wikipedia in another tab, log in, and click on your username. This will
  open up an editing window to create the new page. Try copying and pasting this
  sentence into the editor:

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">
  <code>
  I am part of a course taught by Wiki Education that trains scholars in how to edit
  Wikipedia. Learn more at wikiedu.org. All of my contributions are my own and I
  take responsibility for them.
  </code>
  </p>

  When you're done, type a summary of what you just did where it says "Edit summary"
  at the bottom of the page and click "Publish changes".
