  Behind every great Wikipedia article are Wikipedians working together to
  make it great. These Wikipedians coordinate their work through a “Talk
  page.”

  Every Wikipedia article has its own Talk page. The Talk page is where
  conversations about the article take place.

  Before you start editing an existing article, take a look at the Talk
  page. You can get a sense of the discussions that are underway. If you want
  to discuss major changes or ask a question about the current article, you can
  leave a message on the talk page. Wikipedians with an interest in the topic
  may take note and try to help. The more popular the page, the more likely
  others are to engage in discussion. Remember that while it’s sometimes nice
  to post what changes you plan to make on the talk page, you don’t have to wait
  for “permission” to make a change. Be bold!

  Wikipedians assume you'll be reading messages left in your user Talk
  page and article Talk pages. You can use these pages to leave messages
  for others, too.

  In the [**How to edit**
  training](/training/professional-development/how-to-edit-professional),
  you'll learn how to leave messages on a Talk page.
