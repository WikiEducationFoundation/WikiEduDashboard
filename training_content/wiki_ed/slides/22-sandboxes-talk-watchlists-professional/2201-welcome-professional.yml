  This training module will walk you through the different types of pages
  you'll find on Wikipedia.

  You read that right! There are *article* pages, which are what most
  people think of when they think of Wikipedia. But there are also many
  other types of pages that serve their own purpose. On Wikipedia, you'll
  find **User pages** (including sandboxes), **Talk pages**, **Watchlists**,
  **WikiProjects**, and more.

  In this training, we'll review:

  -   The differences between all of these pages
  -   Where you can practice editing
  -   How and where to talk to other Wikipedia editors
