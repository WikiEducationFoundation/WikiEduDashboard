title: "What's the Dashboard?"
summary:
content: |
  Your course page on our Dashboard is an all-purpose syllabus. It's not
  Wikipedia itself, but rather a tool that keeps track of all the work you do
  within Wikipedia. It's also where you'll access online trainings, homework
  assignments, and meeting recordings.

  You'll find your Dashboard course page in the welcome email. Make sure to
  bookmark the course page in your browser so you can find it again easily. Take
  a look around and familiarize yourself with the tabs.

  From the **Home** tab, you will only see the current week's activities. Click
  the Timeline tab to see the full schedule.

  For each week in the Timeline you'll see the meeting agenda, milestones, tasks
  to focus on for the next week, and helpful resources.
