title: "What's the Dashboard?"
summary:
content: |
  Wiki Education's Dashboard is home to your *course page*, which is an all-purpose syllabus. The Dashboard is not
  Wikipedia itself, but rather a tool that keeps track of all the work you do
  within Wikipedia. It's also where you'll access online trainings, homework
  assignments, and meeting recordings.

  Now, if you haven't done so already, click "Log in" in the upper right
  corner of *this* page. After answering a few questions, you will be connected to the Dashboard. 

  You'll find your Dashboard course page in the welcome email. Make sure to
  bookmark the course page in your browser so you can find it again easily. Take
  a look around and familiarize yourself with the tabs.

  From the **Home** tab, you will see the current week's activities. Click
  the **Timeline** tab to see the *full* course schedule.

  For each week in the Timeline you'll see the meeting agenda, milestones, tasks
  to focus on for the next week, and helpful resources.
