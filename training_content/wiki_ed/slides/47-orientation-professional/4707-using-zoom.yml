title: "Using Zoom"
summary:
content: |
  Zoom is an online video meeting platform. In Zoom meetings, you'll learn from
  Wikipedia Experts and your peer collaborators. Meetings will be recorded and
  available to participants through a password-protected Dropbox folder.

  You will receive a Zoom link by email. If you have not used Zoom before, you will be prompted
  to download its launcher program. It works on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.
  The link will remain the same from week to week, and you can always find it on
  the **Home** tab of the course Dashboard.

  If you cannot access the Zoom call by computer or app,
  you can also call in by phone. Please note that your ability to engage with
  the meeting will be significantly limited if you dial in by phone, as you'll miss
  screenshares, live chat, and other features. Enabling video in meetings is not
  required, but we enable it by default because we've found that meetings are
  more successful when everyone is "face to face."

  Our Zoom meetings are intended to be interactive. If you have a question or comment,
  you're welcome to just ask. In larger groups, or when discussion is particularly
  lively, this can be difficult. For those times, Zoom has a "raise your hand"
  feature, as well as other forms of non-verbal signals you may want to explore.
  Use of these tools is not required, but some people find them helpful.

  Please try to connect in a location without a great
  deal of background noise, and mute your microphone while you're not
  talking.
