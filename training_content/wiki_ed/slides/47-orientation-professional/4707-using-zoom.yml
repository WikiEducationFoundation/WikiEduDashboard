  Zoom is an online video meeting platform. In Zoom meetings, you'll learn from
  Wikipedia experts and your peer collaborators. Meetings will be recorded and
  linked from the Timeline.

  You will receive a link by email which will also be available through your
  Dashboard course page. If you have not used Zoom before, you will be prompted
  to download its launcher program. It works on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.
  The link will remain the same from week to week, and you can always find it on
  the Home tab of the course Dashboard.

  If you cannot access the Zoom call by computer or through the dedicated app,
  you can also call in by phone. Please note that your ability to engage with
  the meeting will be significantly limited if you dial in by phone, missing
  screenshares, live chat, and other features.

  To the extent possible, please try to connect in a location without a great
  deal of background noise, and be sure to mute your microphone while you're not
  talking if sounds may be distracting to others.

  Enabling video in meetings is not required, but we encourage you to turn it on
  to the extent you feel comfortable.

  Among the many features Zoom offers, you may "raise your hand," which signals
  to the facilitator(s) that you have a question or comment. You're also welcome
  to simply start talking. Zoom also permits you to "share your screen" with the
  group. Wiki Education staff will utilize this function frequently.

  If Zoom isn't working, contact the Wikipedia Experts via Slack.
