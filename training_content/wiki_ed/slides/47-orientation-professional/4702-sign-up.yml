  Before we continue, you'll need to sign in to a Wikipedia account. **If you
  already have an accessible account**, feel free to skip this slide and go ahead
  and click "Log in" in the upper right corner.

  **If you don't yet have a Wikipedia account**, proceed:

  First, decide if you want your username to be a pseudonym or a
  version of your real name. Keep in mind that all Wikipedia contributions are
  tied to your username indefinitely, including mistakes.

  In a moment, when you sign up, make sure to associate your account with an email
  address and respond to the confirmation email. Wikipedians will be able to send emails to you, but your
  address will *not* be publicly visible. A confirmed email address is the only
  way to recover an account should you forget the password.
