content: |
  WikiProjects are where you can go to find information about which properties to
  use to describe an item. You will notice that some WikiProjects have a lot of
  documentation about data models, whereas other projects have very little. Creating
  data models is a great way to teach new editors how to properly model items
  and help evaluate item quality.

  In order to create a data model, you need to be familiar with properties that
  are relevant to that particular topic. Visiting item pages within that topic
  is a great way to see which properties an item might use. Here is an example
  of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Medicine/Properties">common properties from WikiProject: Medicine</a>,
  grouped by popular topics.

  Be sure to provide descriptions for the models you create so other users can
  follow your logic.

  In the process of creating a data model, you may also discover that an entire
  property is missing and does not yet exist on Wikidata. You may
  <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Property_proposal">propose a property</a>.
  Property proposals go through a community approval process to ensure the
  property doesn't already exist yet, the property contributes to Wikidata in a
  meaningful way, and the property is formatted correctly.

  **Remember**: Anyone can create a data model, so if you see that a model is
  missing, feel free to propose one.
