  * Explore this <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProjects">list of WikiProjects</a>
  to familiarize yourself with the various projects on Wikidata. You'll find
  data models for every subject-area on this page.
  * Join a WikiProject that interests you.
  * Evaluate a data model and suggest adding some properties that may be missing
  from it. Don't forget that you can find data models on WikiProjects. In the
  event they don't exist, you will have to create them yourself.
  * Propose a property that doesn't exist on Wikidata yet. Think about how to
  describe important concepts in your field. Is there something that expresses
  important connections between these concepts and others? When you try to add
  more information to items are you frustrated because a current property is not
  the best fit? This could be a candidate for a new property.
  * Propose an entire data model for a concept or thing that does not exist yet.
  The more well-documented data models Wikidata has, the easier it will be for
  editors to contribute in a meaningful way and the easier it will be for users
  to understand how Wikidata works.
