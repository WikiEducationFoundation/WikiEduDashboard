        start modeling items on your own without sharing that model with anyone
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Wikidata is a collaborative project. Although we encourage
        you to be bold and share your expertise, inviting others to participate
        in the discussion is the best way to approach data models.

        give up on the item and find something with an existing model to work on.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Don't give up! It may require extra work to create a data model,
        but the community benefits from them.

        use the Discussion page of the WikiProject to propose a data model.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! Discussion pages of WikiProjects are the ideal place to go to
        propose a data model. It's always a good idea to involve the community
        and WikiProjects are subject-themed, so participants will have some
        knowledge about the models you're proposing.

        consult the Wikidata manual, which has a section on official data models.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! All data models are community-produced, established by
        consensus, so there is no "official" data model. Either data models are
        documented on WikiProjects or they are not. There is also no Wikidata
        manual...at least not yet.
