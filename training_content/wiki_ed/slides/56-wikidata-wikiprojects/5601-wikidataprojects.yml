summary:
content: |
  WikiProjects are dedicated to addressing information quality, content gaps,
  maintenance, and building community on Wikidata. Editors join WikiProjects to
  improve specific areas of Wikidata.

  Like Wikipedia, some topic areas on Wikidata are more comprehensive than others.
  WikiProjects are the first place to go to learn about the state of whatever
  topic you are interested in on Wikidata.

  Every WikiProject on Wikidata has its own set of editors and standards to
  cater to the needs of that particular topic. Typically WikiProjects contain
  data models, property usage, completion statistics, and a conversation about 
  that particular topic.

  **Note**: WikiProjects exist on both Wikidata and Wikipedia. They may have
  the same titles, but they are different WikiProjects. The WikiProjects on
  Wikidata focus on Wikidata-specific issues like modeling items, creating new
  properties, and evaluating gaps in the disciplines. WikiProjects on Wikipedia
  discuss article content, track article statistics (like Good Articles or
  Featured Articles), and gather Wikipedia-specific templates.
