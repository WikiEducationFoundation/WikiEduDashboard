title: "Joining a WikiProject"
summary:
content: |
  Joining a WikiProject means you will receive communications about that
  particular project. Some projects allow you to volunteer for certain areas to
  improve, other projects have a lot of group work to address project needs.

  All WikiProjects have a participants section. Every participant section should
  have a button that says "[+] Add yourself to the list." When you click that
  button, the page will go into "edit mode." Scroll to the bottom and sign your
  name with <code>~~~~</code>, which will automatically generate your username
  and a time stamp, click "Publish Changes" and now you're part of a WikiProject!

  Whether or not you are part of a WikiProject you can always leave a message
  on the Discussion tab of a WikiProject or by reaching out to individuals who
  are part of the project. Introduce yourself and ask a question or share what
  you are interested in doing.

  If ever you want to leave a WikiProject, you can click "[+] Add yourself to
  the list," delete your name, click "Publish Changes," and you'll be removed
  from that project.
