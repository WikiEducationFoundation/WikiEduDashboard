title: "So, what exactly will you be doing?"
summary:
content: |
  You will meet with students enrolled in other Wiki Education courses through a video conference using Intertwine (more about this next page!) 

  You will first exchange your Wikipedia article with peers. You will provide feedback on their articles, and they will provide you feedback on yours. You can ask for their general thoughts or ask for feedback on a specific part that you think needs the most work. It all depends on you! In addition, you are going to communicate your thoughts to other students using the Wikipedia way -- using Talk pages :)

  Not sure where to start with the evaluation? No worries! we have included detailed instructions in the session to ensure the best outcomes, and you will of course get help from your peers :)
