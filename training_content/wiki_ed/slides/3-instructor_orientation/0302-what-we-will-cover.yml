title: What we’ll cover
summary:
content: >
  First, we’ll look at some of Wikipedia's core policies and guidelines. 


  Then, we’ll go over the basics of designing a Wikipedia assignment by sharing
  what we’ve learned from hundreds of instructors since 2010. We’ll also discuss 
  a few common Wikipedia assignments.


  Finally, we’ll give you an overview of the tools and support offered by the Wiki Education
  Foundation.


  You might want to complement this overview by taking the student training later
  on. That way, you’ll learn greater details about editing, and see the
  Wikipedia training for your students.
