title: Avoid minimum word requirements
summary:
content: |
  When it comes to contributing to Wikipedia, quality is far more important than
  quantity. Adding 1,000 words to Wikipedia may be as time intensive as writing
  a 3,000 word term paper. Reorganizing an existing popular article and deleting
  outdated or inappropriate information can be as impactful as writing a new
  one. In other words, one student may contribute significantly fewer words than
  another, but the overall quality of the work is better.

  This unique aspect of Wikipedia makes minimum requirements difficult to set.
  If you do wish to establish a minimum requirement, it is far better to
  **require a minimum number of references** rather than words. Wiki Education
  staff will not approve a course that requires students to add a minimum number
  of words.

  Students who are accustomed to minimum essay requirements may struggle with
  the more flexible nature of a Wikipedia assignment. To help them adjust, you
  can set clear expectations about what they should be doing each step of the
  way.
