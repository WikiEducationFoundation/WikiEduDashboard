  Once your course is underway, youâ€™ll be assigned a Wiki Education staff member
  (a "Wikipedia Expert") who provides Wikipedia know-how during the assignment.

  Wiki Education is dedicated to intervening with students who encounter problems
  and challenges on Wikipedia. That said, we're a small nonprofit organization,
  and each Wikipedia Expert supports more than 3,000 students at once. We're able
  to provide high-quality, timely support thanks to the tools we've built into the
  Wiki Education Dashboard, which is why we can only offer staff support to courses
  officially participating in the Student Program. Here's what you can expect from
  your Wikipedia Expert:

  * Students and instructors may reach out to their Wikipedia Expert regarding
  technical and stylistic aspects of Wikipedia editing, Wikipedia policy, and
  interactions with other members of the Wikipedia editing community. Before
  reaching out to your Wikipedia Expert, instructors and students should consult
  Wiki Education's robust resources.
  * Your Wikipedia Expert may make minor changes to student work while in their sandbox,
  and may make more substantial edits once moved into the article main space. In
  all cases, these edits are made to help the article conform with Wikipedia policy.
