  Once your course is underway, youâ€™ll be assigned a Wiki Education staff member
  (a "Wikipedia Expert") who provides Wikipedia know-how during the assignment.

  Wiki Education is dedicated to intervening with students who encounter
  problems and challenges on Wikipedia. That said, we're a small nonprofit
  organization, and each Wikipedia Expert supports more than 3,000 students at
  once. We're able to provide high-quality, timely support thanks to the tools
  we've built into the Wiki Education Dashboard, which is why we can only offer
  staff support to courses officially participating in the Classroom Program.
  Here are the ways we can support your Wikipedia assignment:

  * monitoring day-to-day student editing, intervening to help as necessary
  * recognizing quality work
  * flagging plagiarism and copyright violations
  * explaining Wikipedia policies, guidelines, and etiquette
