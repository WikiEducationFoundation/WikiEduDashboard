title: Conflicts of interest
summary:
content: |
  You and your students should disclose any conflicts of interest you have while
  editing topics related to your field. A conflict of interest isn’t a judgment
  on you or the information, it’s an acknowledgement of your relationship to the
  material you’re sharing.

  Generally, assigning students to do any of the following will raise concerns:
  * rely on a textbook you've written
  * cite your research
  * publicize a department chair or an organization related to your school

  Students can use a textbook you've written as one part of a diverse
  bibliography. However, they should disclose the conflict of interest on the
  article's Talk page.
