  Now that we're almost at the end of the training, you may have some additional
  questions. We've developed an online tool where you can ask questions and
  easily find answers from Wiki Ed staff.


  If you have any questions, visit [**ask.wikiedu.org**](http://ask.wikiedu.org/questions/).
  You can search previously asked questions, and if your answer isn't there,
  post it and our staff will respond.


  You can always pose questions to your Wikipedia Expert, found through a link on
  your course page. And finally, you can ask the Classroom Program Manager,
  who will be in touch after you create your course page.
