title: Designing a Wikipedia assignment
summary:
content: |
  Good assignment design sets students up for success, and reduces the chances
  of having their work deleted. It must be a meaningful assignment that both
  builds students' skills and meets Wikipedia's requirements.

  The Wiki Education Dashboard initiates this process by creating a template for
  students to follow. You can customize the assignment, and Wiki Education staff
  will review it to make sure students will complete all necessary steps while
  contributing to Wikipedia. Up next, we'll review the available assignment
  types and considerations you should make as you create your course page on the
  Dashboard.
