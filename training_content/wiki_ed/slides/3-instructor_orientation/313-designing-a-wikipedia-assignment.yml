title: Designing a Wikipedia assignment
summary:
content: |
  With so many ways to participate in the Wikipedia community, instructors may
  find the assignment design possibilities overwhelming. Good assignment design
  will set students up for success and reduce the chances of having their work
  deleted. It must be a meaningful assignment that meets Wikipedia’s requirements
  while simultaneously building students' content knowledge, writing and
  communication skills, and overall information literacy. 

  The Wiki Education Dashboard assists you with this process via the “Assignment
  Wizard,” which provides you with adaptable templates for students to follow.
  You can customize the assignment, and Wiki Education staff will review it to
  make sure students will complete all necessary steps while contributing to Wikipedia. 

  In the next few slides, we'll review the available assignment types and
  considerations you should make as you create your course page on the Dashboard.
