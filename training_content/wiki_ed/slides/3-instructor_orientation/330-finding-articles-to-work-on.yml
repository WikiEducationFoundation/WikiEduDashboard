title: Finding articles for students to work on
summary:
content: |
  As you design the Wikipedia assignment, you may choose to prepare a list of
  articles your students can work on.

  To help you find good candidates for your students to improve (or create),
  we've created an optional orientation module. It explores how to find articles
  that the Wikipedia community has identified as needing help. You can complete
  that (10-minute) module by clicking the green button below. The module will
  open in a new tab, and you can continue from here when you reach the end. If
  you'd prefer to complete it later, you can find the *Finding Articles* module
  from the Dashboard's "Training" link.
