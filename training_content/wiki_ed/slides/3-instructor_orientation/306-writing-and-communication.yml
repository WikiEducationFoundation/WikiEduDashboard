  One of the most valuable aspects of the Wikipedia editing experience is that it enables
  students to practice public writing. Since they are used to writing traditional academic
  papers that are only read by instructors or a few peers, the opportunity to showcase
  their knowledge demands sophisticated writing skills.

  When something is missing or wrong on Wikipedia, it isn’t as simple as filling in the
  blank or correcting the error. A student considers the kind of knowledge that can be
  made about a given article, in terms of who publishes about that topic, the reputation
  of the publication, as well as the quantity and availability of those sources. They must
  convey the accurate information about a subject after weighing competing claims and
  evidence about the topic for the purposes of communicating the state of its knowledge
  in a “neutral” style to a lay audience (e.g., not explicitly making arguments about
  how they feel about how that knowledge is made or whether it is “good or bad”).

  In the Wikipedia assignment, students build writing and communication skills by: 
  * Identifying an audience beyond the instructor: Wikipedia’s global audience of readers
  * Researching topics appropriate to the course and discipline
  * Engaging in formal communication processes to share ideas publicly
  * Exchanging feedback through peer review
  * Adhering to ethical standards of writing to avoid plagiarism
  * Drafting, revising, and editing their work.
