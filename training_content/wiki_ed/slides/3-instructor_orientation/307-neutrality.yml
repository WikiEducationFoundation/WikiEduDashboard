title: Neutrality
summary:
content: |
  On Wikipedia, we aim to represent significant views fairly, proportionately,
  and without bias. Wikipedians call this "neutral point of view" (NPOV).

  Articles donâ€™t take sides, but describe expert viewpoints published in
  authoritative, reliable sources. Most students have been trained to write
  persuasively in their papers, drawing conclusions and advocating for
  solutions. In a Wikipedia assignment, they should only present facts.
  Wikipedia lets people interpret those facts for themselves.

  In academia, we understand the limitations of neutrality. The Wikipedia
  assignment offers a unique opportunity for students to discuss bias and
  neutrality while dissecting the boundaries of knowledge construction. When
  students disagree with Wikipedia's policies and expectations, encourage them
  to share insights with you and their peers.
