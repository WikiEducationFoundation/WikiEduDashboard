title: About Wiki Education
summary:
content: |
  Wiki Education is an independent nonprofit organization devoted to bridging traditional institutions of knowledge
  and Wikipedia. In this orientation, you'll be introduced to the Wikipedia Student Program wherein instructors
  assign their students to contribute to Wikipedia either in lieu of or in addition to a traditional writing assignment.

  Through our programs we aim to:

  * Train students, faculty, and other professionals to contribute to Wikipedia in their fields of expertise.
  * Improve Wikipedia's equity, quality, and reach.
  * Close Wikipedia's equity gaps, especially in equity areas.
  * Broadly build connections between the worlds of Wikipedia, academia, and other institutions of knowledge.
