  Most students will have never contributed to Wikipedia before this course. New
  editors face several barriers when joining the Wikipedia community, and Wiki
  Education's goal is to reduce those barriers and minimize the learning curve.
  That's why we create free training resources and help forums to prevent common
  problems.

  When you join the Classroom Program, you get access to our Wikipedia expertise
  and the following resources:
  * the Wiki Education Dashboard, a learning management system for the Wikipedia
  assignment
  * interactive online student trainings with progress reports to assess
  completion
  * supplementary printed brochures about how to edit Wikipedia
  * access to ask.wikiedu.org, a help forum with frequently asked questions
  about Wikipedia and the Wikipedia assignment
  * Wiki Education staff intervention for problems you encounter on Wikipedia

  Let's learn more about each of these resources.
