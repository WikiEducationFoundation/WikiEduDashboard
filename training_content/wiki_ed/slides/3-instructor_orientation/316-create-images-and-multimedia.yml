  Wikipedia isnâ€™t just for words. Students can improve articles by adding
  photographs, illustrations, graphs, or videos. This assignment asks students
  to find articles that could be improved through multimedia content, then
  produce that content and share it on the article. Crucially, students must
  complete our *Plagiarism and Copyright Violation* training to avoid adding
  unacceptable content to Wikipedia.

  Timeline: 2 weeks (minimum)

  Suitable for:
  * Multimedia, photography, or illustration courses
  * Courses where students visualize data and create original graphs/charts
  * Courses studying and practicing copyright law
  * Any size course

  Student learning outcomes:
  * Media and information literacy
  * Communication skills
  * Copyright law in practice

  *For a more in-depth review, see our supplemental [case study](/training/instructors/illustration-assignment).*
