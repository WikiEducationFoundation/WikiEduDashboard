  Throughout their Wikipedia assignments, student work will be
  monitored by the AI detection tool Pangram.

  Every time Pangram detects possible AI text, you and your student
  will receive an email. This email will ask the student to tell
  us more about the situation, including whether it was a false
  positive – when the AI tool incorrectly identifies the text as
  generative AI output. 

  Please encourage your student to fill out this brief report.
