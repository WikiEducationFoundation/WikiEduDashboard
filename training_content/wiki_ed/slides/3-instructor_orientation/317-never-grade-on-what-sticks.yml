title: Never grade based on what sticks
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia has fostered an open community where editors are encouraged to build
  on others' work. Student work may be revised or, in rare cases, removed 
  entirely by other Wikipedians. Over the years, this has been the hardest part
  of the Wikipedia assignment for students and faculty to understand.

  Instructors have found success by informing students early on and regularly
  that they're graded on the research process and quality of the work they add,
  not on "what sticks" in the article at the end of the term. This aspect of
  Wikipedia editing is simply out of the student's control, whereas they can
  control whether they complete each training module, research their topic, draft
  their work, participate in a peer review, and incorporate feedback into a final
  contribution. We encourage you to make these parameters clear to your students
  so they know that they will be graded based on their engagement with the processes
  of editing, not necessarily the “complete” product. After all, Wikipedia is a
  dynamic, continuously evolving resource.
