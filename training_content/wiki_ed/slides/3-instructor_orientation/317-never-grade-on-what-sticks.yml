title: Never grade based on what sticks
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia has fostered an open community where editors are encouraged to build
  on others' work. And as mentioned before, there's a small chance someone
  removes a student's work entirely. Over the years, this has been the hardest
  part of the Wikipedia assignment for students to understand.

  Instructors have found success by informing students early on and regularly
  that they're graded on the research process and quality of the work they add,
  not on "what sticks" in the article at the end of the term. This aspect is
  simply out of the student's control, whereas they can control whether they
  complete each training module, research their topic, draft their work, peer
  review, and incorporate feedback into a final contribution. It's critical that
  students know this is how they're graded.

#  and assessment* training module.
