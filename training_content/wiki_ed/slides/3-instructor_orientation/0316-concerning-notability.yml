title: Notability

content: >
  As students create new articles on topics relevant to your field, it may not
  be immediately clear to other Wikipedians that the topic warrants a Wikipedia article.

  The Wikipedians who monitor new articles are sorting through a barrage of spam, joke pages,
  and self-promotion. They will quickly review a page for sources that establish *notability*.


  The best way to show that a topic is notable is to show that there is significant coverage
  in reliable sources, and (if applicable) independent of the *subject* of the article. (We'll
  discuss this further in a minute).


  If Wikipedians can't find these sources, they're likely to remove the article and quickly
  move on to the next in the queue. Thatâ€™s why many assignments encourage students to collect
  resources first, and to share that bibliography on the article's Talk page, even going so
  far as to state *"this topic is notable because..."*

  Expert assigned to your course.
