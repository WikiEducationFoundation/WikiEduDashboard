  Joining the Wiki Education Classroom Program means creating a course page on
  our Dashboard, a learning management system we've custom-built for the
  Wikipedia assignment.

  When you create a course page, the Dashboard suggests a template and timeline
  that breaks all necessary steps of a Wikipedia assignment into weekly tasks,
  training modules, and milestones. You can customize the timeline before
  submitting it for approval.
