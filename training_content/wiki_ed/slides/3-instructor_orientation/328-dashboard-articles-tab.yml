  The **Articles** tab has three sections with information about your students'
  activity on Wikipedia

  ## Articles Edited ##

  This table shows every live Wikipedia article your students have worked on,
  along with how much content they added and how many page views the article has
  had since students started editing.

  You can click on an individual article's row to see more details, including:

  * Cumulative Changes: the "diff viewer," a tool summarizing all changes to the
  article from the students' first edit to their last
  * Current Version: the latest version of the article, with highlighting of
  which parts were added by which students
  * Article Development: a graph of the article's "Structural Completeness" over
  time
  * all students who worked on this article

  ## Assigned Articles ##

  This table shows which student(s) are working on and reviewing which
  article(s). You can use this to make sure every article has reviewers, and to
  see which students are collaborating on the same article.

  Each assigned article also has a "feedback" button that predicts the
  article's new rating (based on Wikipedia's rating scale) and allows you and
  Wiki Education staff to send suggestions about the article. Students can click
  this button or visit the Home tab to see any suggestions that others have left.

  ## Available Articles ##

  This table gives you the option of creating a list of good topics for students
  to work on. When a student chooses one of the Available Articles, it is
  removed from the list, so students won't accidentally duplicate work.
