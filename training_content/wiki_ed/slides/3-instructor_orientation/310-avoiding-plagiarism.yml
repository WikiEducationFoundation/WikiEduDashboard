title: Avoiding plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  The rise of generative AI has further complicated issues around
  plagiarism. When writing for Wikipedia, plagiarism can arise
  when students are navigating too much information and can’t
  quite manage to “say it in their own words.” But it can also
  be a result of copying and pasting from a generative AI chatbot,
  which can produce text very similar to the original source. We
  encourage you to explicitly address plagiarism in your courses,
  but not solely in punitive terms. Modeling paraphrasing and
  developing writing strategies for summarizing material offer
  some ways to help students avoid plagiarism and improve their
  writing skills simultaneously.

  Fortunately, Wikipedia has standards and practices in place to
  delete plagiarism and close paraphrasing. To prevent their work
  from being removed or their accounts from being blocked, students
  should handle sources with great care, using their sandbox to
  document where they locate information about their topic and
  maintain an organized system for tracking sources. This approach
  will help them distinguish between their own writing and that of
  their references, and ensure that their contributions are written
  in their own words. All students receive a link to our
  “[Plagiarism](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/plagiarism)”
  training module on their course page.
