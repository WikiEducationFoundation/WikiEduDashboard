title: Avoiding plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  Students plagiarize, usually because they don't know how to avoid it.
  Wikipedia is published under a free Creative Commons license, meaning
  copyrighted material (without a compatible free license) is strictly
  forbidden. For your students, this means Wikipedia has standards and practices
  in place to delete plagiarism and close paraphrasing. Students can avoid a
  sticky situation where their hard work gets removed or they face being banned.
  They should scrutinize their own work — and their peers' work during the peer
  review process — to guarantee the content is in their own words.

  ### Resources
  * Wiki Education has created a required [Plagiarism and Copyright Violation
  training module](/training/students/plagiarism) that students will complete.
  * Wikipedia has tools that continuously monitor for suspected plagiarism.
  Wiki Education staff review plagiarism reports daily, delete any plagiarism or
  close paraphrasing, and post warnings to students to help them understand how
  to avoid this.
  * Repeat offenders will receive a second warning and notification that another
  editor may block them temporarily. At this point, Wiki Education staff will
  notify you, link to relevant plagiarism reports, and ask you to remind
  students how important it is to write in their own words. It's up to you
  whether to follow any university protocol regarding plagiarism.
