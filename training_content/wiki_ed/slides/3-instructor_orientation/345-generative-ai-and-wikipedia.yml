title: Generative AI and Wikipedia
content: |
  Many of our training modules include guidance for students on how
  to thoughtfully and critically use generative AI tools to support
  their work on Wikipedia – and **only if permitted by your own course
  policies**.

  All students will also be assigned Wiki Education’s generative
  AI training module
  “[Using generative AI tools with Wikipedia](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/generative-ai),”
  which explains why AI-generated text is bad for Wikipedia and
  offers tips for using AI tools in limited and specific ways during
  the research phase of the Wikipedia assignment (again, if permitted
  by your course policies).

  The main takeaway? Students should NOT copy and paste generative
  AI output for any part of their Wikipedia assignment, including
  all exercises. This also means they shouldn’t use copyediting tools
  like Grammarly.
