  When you click a student's row, you'll enter the Assignments & Exercises view, which includes:

  * their progress in the online trainings
  * details about their assigned articles and associated drafts
  * links to their peer reviews
  * a list of their most recent Wikipedia activity
  * the article viewer tool for each 

  You can manage the student's assigned articles and peer reviews from here.

  You can also use the **Article Viewer** tool for each assigned article to see the latest version
  of the article, with authorship highlighting to indicate which text added by your students.
