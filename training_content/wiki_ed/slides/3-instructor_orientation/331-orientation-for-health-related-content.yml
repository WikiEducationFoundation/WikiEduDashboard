title: Medical and Psychology topics
summary:
content: |
  If your students might touch any aspect of any article related to human health,
  please take the **Assigning Medical and Psychology Topics** module. Students regularly
  encounter medical subjects in courses on medicine, psychology, sociology, anthropology,
  women's and gender studies, or general writing courses.

  Because so many people use Wikipedia to self-diagnose or self-treat, any articles that
  touch on human health are held to higher standards. Learning about the Wikipedia
  community's expectations will help ensure students contribute high quality work.

  If you are teaching in one of these fields, we strongly recommend that you check out the below training.
