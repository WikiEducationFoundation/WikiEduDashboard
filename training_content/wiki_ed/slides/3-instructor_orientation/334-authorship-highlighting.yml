  The Article Viewer tool — <img style="margin: -18px -8px;" src="/assets/images/article-viewer.svg" alt="Authorship Viewer icon"/> —
  shows the current version of the article. Once authorship data has
  loaded, it also overlays details about which text was introduced by which
  student. The Article Viewer is available on the Articles tab for each
  of the mainspace articles edited by your students, as well as in the
  Assignments & Exercises view of the Students tab, for assigned articles.
  This is your best way to identify your students' contributions in existing
  articles — and to see who did what for a single article edited by a group
  of students.

  Note that authorship highlighting works well for most article content, but
  may not include images, templates, and footnotes that your students added.
