  The Article Viewer tool, which shows the current version on the article and
  overlays details about which text was introduced by which student, is
  available on the Articles tab for each of the mainspace articles edited by
  your students. This is your best way to identify your students' contributions
  in existing articles â€” and to see who did what for a single article edited
  by a group of students.
