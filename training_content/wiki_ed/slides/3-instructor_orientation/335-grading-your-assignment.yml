title: Grading your assignment
summary:

  Consider these tips as you develop a grading rubric for the Wikipedia assignment:

  * Check the Dashboard regularly, monitoring student progress on the weekly
  tasks.
  * Most students work on existing articles, which can be more work than
  creating a new article altogether.
  * The Dashboard does not allow you to enter grades.
  * You may grade each task on a scale or as Complete/Incomplete.
  * We strongly recommend grading your students on whether they've completed the
  training modules.
  * Required reflection papers help you learn about the work students did, and
  they're a great place for length requirements like words or pages.
  * The [back page of the Editing Wikipedia brochure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_%28Wiki_Education_Foundation%29_%282017%29.pdf#page=15)
  offers a handy checklist for evaluating student work.
  * Here's a sample grading rubric ( [PDF version](https://wikiedu.org/gradingrubric) | [.doc version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3i6e12ea4rewzq6/GradingAssessmentTable_16Apr2020.docx?dl=0) ) you can
  customize or distribute to students for guidance.
