  This is the “classic” Wikipedia writing assignment, and it's likely the one
  you're here for. Students work individually or in small groups to create or
  expand a Wikipedia article on a given topic. They can research and write an
  article from scratch or expand an existing article.

  Timeline: 6 weeks (minimum) to 12 weeks (ideal).

  Suitable for:
  * All disciplines
  * Classes with fewer than 50 students
  * Classes with 50–100 students
      * Required: all teaching assistants complete this orientation and sign up
      on the Dashboard
      * Recommended: students work in small groups; assignment is optional
  * Undergraduate and graduate students
  * Honors assignments and independent study

  Student learning outcomes:
  * Writing and communication skills
  * Information literacy
  * Critical thinking
  * Research skills
  * Collaboration
