  The main **Home** tab of your dashboard course page features a motivational
  bar showing your students’ impact on Wikipedia: How many articles they have
  worked on or created, how much content they have contributed, and, how many
  readers have checked out those articles! You can share this at the end of the
  assignment to drive home the impact that students have made.

  This overview also has introductory text about your course, the current or
  upcoming activity from the Timeline, and other details. You'll find your
  Wikipedia Expert listed here.
