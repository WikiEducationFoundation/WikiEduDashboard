summary:
content: |
  Wiki Education staff will review your submitted course page to make sure it
  meets program requirements. We have designed the following policies based on
  thousands of successful Wikipedia assignments. These standards facilitate a
  great learning experience and fulfill our commitment to the Wikipedia community
  to set students up for success.

  * Fewer than 100 students should participate in the Wikipedia assignment.
  * Courses broken into multiple sections, taught by multiple TAs, are not well-suited for the Wikipedia assignment.
  * Students should spend a minimum of 6 weeks on the Wikipedia assignment, including the research and writing process.
  * The course page timeline must include links to the Wikipedia training modules.
  * The course page should convey the types of contributions students will make and when you expect them to work in each stage.

  If you think your Wikipedia assignment does not meet these requirements,
  please reach out to us at contact@wikiedu.org to discuss assignment design
  and how we can collaborate.
