  When your course is underway, youâ€™ll be assigned a **Wikipedia Expert**. They
  can help at every step of the process, including:

  * answering questions about adapting your course or course timeline

  * monitoring day-to-day activities of your students

  * generating lists of course-related articles students could improve

  * acknowledging quality work, or flagging plagiarism and copyright violations

  * explaining Wikipedia policies, guidelines, and etiquette
