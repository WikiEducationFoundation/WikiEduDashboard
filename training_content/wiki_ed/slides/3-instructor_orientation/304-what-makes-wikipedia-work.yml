title: What makes Wikipedia work?
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, meaning articles should be based on reputable
  publications. Students will add summaries of knowledge they find in
  high-quality sources, and they back up everything they write. Citations allow
  readers to dig deeper into topics, verifying the information they find on
  Wikipedia. This verifiability makes Wikipedia a unique website, and it's how
  we have moderated misinformation and fake news since launching in 2001.

  Your students are not joining a static website where they can publish a
  traditional paper. They are joining the *Wikipedia community*, made up of real
  humans who volunteer their time and hard work to provide one of the world's
  most valuable resources. It's crucial for you and your students to understand
  Wikipedia's culture so you can participate respectfully.

  If students follow our trainings and assignment milestones, available to them
  via your Dashboard course page, they should feel equipped to participate in
  this incredible initiative to make comprehensive, diverse knowledge available
  to the world.
