  The **Home** tab features a motivational bar showing your studentsâ€™ impact on
  Wikipedia: How many articles they have worked on or created, how much content
  they have contributed, and how many readers have viewed those articles.
  Sharing these statistics drives home the impact that students have made to
  Wikipedia readers, which can highly motivate them.

  On the Home tab, you'll describe the course and Wikipedia assignment. Students
  will find upcoming training modules and milestones as well as the Wikipedia
  Expert they can go to for help.
