  The **Home** tab features a motivational bar showing your students’ impact on Wikipedia: How many
  articles they have worked on or created, how much content they have contributed, and how many
  readers have viewed those articles. Sharing these statistics drives home the impact that students
  have made to Wikipedia readers, which can highly motivate them.

  On the Home tab, you'll describe the course and Wikipedia assignment. Students will find upcoming
  training modules and milestones as well as the Wikipedia Expert they can go to for help.

  On the home tab, your students will have a section entitled "My Articles" where they will be able
  to assign themselves articles to work on and peer review as well as check on each stage of their
  assignment. This section is only visible to students.
