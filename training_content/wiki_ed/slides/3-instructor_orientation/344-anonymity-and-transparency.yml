title: Anonymity and transparency
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia generally encourages anonymity when it comes to editors.
  However, participating in the Wikipedia Student Program as an instructor departs
  from this culture of an anonymity in an important way: when you create and submit
  your course page on the Dashboard, your username and real name will be public
  information in connection with the course.

  Making instructors' names and class institutions public provides an extra degree
  of transparency to the Wikipedia community with respect to our programs, since
  much of our efforts to coordinate editing activity and bring new contributors to
  Wikipedia happens "off-wiki" â€” departing from the long-standing norm within
  Wikipedia that coordinated editing work should take place in public.

  If you are already a Wikipedia editor, or you wish to become one while preserving
  your anonymity, please consider using a separate account for your own editing
  versus the one you use on the Dashboard as an instructor. (You may want to
  consult [Wikipedia's policy on the use of multiple accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry#Legitimate_uses).)

  ## Student anonymity ##
  
  Students enter their real names on the Dashboard when they first use it, but
  these real names will only be accessible to you (as an instructor for their course)
  and to Wiki Education staff. Students cannot see each other's real names on the
  Dashboard. In constrast to your own identity, only the students' usernames will be
  publicly associated with the course.

  You should encourage students to create anonymous usernames of their own choosing.
  A personally identifiable username (for example, one that includes part or all of
  your real name) is allowed, but discouraged.
