  Wikipedia has thousands of "help pages," and Wiki Education staff work every
  term to curate this mass of information into guidelines for student editors.
  We have a suite of editing brochures available online as PDFs.

  Students report that they love printed materials they can consult during the
  Wikipedia assignment. That's why we're committed to sending the general
  Editing Wikipedia brochure and relevant subject-specific brochures to your
  class for free. When you create a course page on the Wiki Education Dashboard,
  you'll select the materials relevant to your class, guaranteeing easy access
  for students. We'll ask for a mailing address so you can distribute these
  training materials.

  Peruse our [current selection of editing brochures on the Wiki Education
  website](http://wikiedu.org/for-instructors/). We suggest you bookmark this
  page right now!
