  Wikipedia has thousands of "help pages," and Wiki Education staff work every
  term to curate this mass of information into guidelines for student editors.
  We have a suite of editing brochures available online as PDFs, which are
  especially useful in printed form.

  Peruse our [current selection of editing brochures on the Wiki Education
  website](http://wikiedu.org/for-instructors/). We suggest you bookmark this
  page right now!
