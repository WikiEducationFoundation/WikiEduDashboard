title: Responding to plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  Wiki Education has created a required [Plagiarism and Copyright Violation
  training module](/training/students/plagiarism) that students should complete.
  
  Wikipedia has tools that continuously monitor for suspected plagiarism.
  Wiki Education staff review plagiarism reports regularly, and may delete
  plagiarism or close paraphrasing, and post warnings to students to help
  them understand how to avoid this. You'll receive an automated email whenever
  suspected plagiarism by one of your students is detected.

  Repeat offenders will receive a second warning and notification that they
  may be blocked from editing, and Wiki Education staff may ask you to remind
  students how important it is to write in their own words.

  It's up to you whether to follow any university protocol regarding plagiarism.
