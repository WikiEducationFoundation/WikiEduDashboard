  Our [student training modules](/training/students) dive into the fundamentals
  new editors must understand to be successful on Wikipedia and in the
  classroom. The student trainings are assigned on the Wiki Education Dashboard,
  and students complete relevant modules for each step in the process.

  The trainings offer key information about:

  * the Wikipedia community and policies
  * how encyclopedic writing differs from traditional term papers
  * citations and how to evaluate sources' reliability
  * plagiarism and how to avoid close paraphrasing
  * technical aspects of editing Wikipedia
  * where and how to draft Wikipedia contributions

  Youâ€™ll have the option of assigning additional mini-modules throughout your
  course about:
  * how to contribute to medical and psychology articles
  * how to find articles to work on
  * how to translate articles

  We strongly encourage you to go through each of your course's assigned training
  modules and exercises as well. Once you've set up your course on the Dashboard,
  you can find these on the Timeline and Resources tabs of your course page.
