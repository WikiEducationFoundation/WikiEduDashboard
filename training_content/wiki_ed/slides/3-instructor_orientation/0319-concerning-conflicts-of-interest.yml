title: 'Conflict of Interest (“COI”)'
summary:
content: >
  Wikipedia strives for neutral, verifiable information that doesn’t come
  directly from the subject. That’s why it’s important to disclose any
  conflicts of interest you have while editing topics related to your field.
  Conflict of Interest isn’t a judgement on you or the information, it’s an
  acknowledgement of your relationship to the material you’re sharing.


  Generally, assigning students to do any of the following will raise concerns:

  * Rely on a textbook you've written

  * Cite your research

  * Publicize a department chair, or an organization operated out of your school


  Students can use a textbook you've written as one part of a diverse
  bibliography. However, they should disclose the conflict of interest on the
  Talk page of the article.
