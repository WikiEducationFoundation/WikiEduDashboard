  Digital literacy — the ability to discern reliable information from the unreliable on a variety of media
  platforms — is a fundamental skill for today's students. When students begin to understand Wikipedia's
  rigorous sourcing policies, they

    * learn how to differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary sources.
    * learn how to identify sources that are reliable and verifiable.
    * learn how to identify bias in sourcing.
    * begin to understand how knowledge is constructed and how inequities in knowledge stem from ideas around sourcing.
