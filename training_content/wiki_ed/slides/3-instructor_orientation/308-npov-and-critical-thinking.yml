  Both students and instructors in our Student Program value Wikipedia
  assignments for teaching critical thinking skills better than traditional coursework.

  As students navigate Wikipedia's neutrality requirements, they cultivate these skills.
  They must:
  * Evaluate which sources are most authoritative, considering publishers, format, date
  of publication, and author bias
  * Analyze competing claims about a subject and assess the validity of their evidence
  * Accurately describe multiple, differing viewpoints and their significance, without
  overemphasizing any one particular viewpoint

  Students present facts so readers can form their own judgment. By producing
  knowledge in this manner, they learn how to consume knowledge in the same way,
  thus developing critical thinking skills.
