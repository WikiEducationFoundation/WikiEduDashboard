  To help students adjust to writing in a new medium, here are some tips:

  If students are selecting their own articles, clarify that they must select
  articles that are both underdeveloped on Wikipedia and have significant
  coverage in reliable sources. This is where setting a minimum number of
  references can help them identify a suitable topic.

  Remind students that they should be less concerned about word count, and
  more concerned with filling in content gaps based on the available literature.

  Remind your students to always adhere to Wikipedia's policies and norms for
  conduct, completing all training modules when assigned.

  Students should never request special treatment as a student completing a
  classroom assignment. The goal is to integrate into the Wikipedia community,
  and while students are a valuable part of that community, they should not
  expect to be treated differently.
