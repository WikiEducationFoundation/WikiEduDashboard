  The **Timeline** tab lists all Wikipedia-based tasks and milestones for the
  assignment. You can edit these blocks to incorporate your own course
  activities or readings if you'd like to make this a one-stop resource for
  students. Whether you use it for all course activities or only the Wikipedia
  portion of the course is up to you.

  The timeline is divided into weeks, based on the dates and holidays you enter
  for your course, with blocks representing individual assignments or
  activities. They include all required training modules for students, so they
  should become familiar with this space as their guideline for the assignment.
  When you create your course page, we'll load a template that you can edit,
  rearrange, and expand according to your classroom needs.
