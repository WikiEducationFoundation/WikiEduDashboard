  If you're an instructor at an institution of higher education in the U.S. and Canada
  and you'd like to run a Wikipedia assignment, then you're in the right place. 

  If you're outside of the U.S. or Canada, or outside of higher education, the independent
  Wikimedia Foundation education team can help you find local resources to
  support your project. In that case, you can create a course page using the Programs & Events
  Dashboard (<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org">outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org</a>).
  Email the Wikimedia team at <a href="mailto:education@wikimedia.org">education@wikimedia.org</a>.
