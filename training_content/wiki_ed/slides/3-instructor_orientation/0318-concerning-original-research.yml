  On the internet, nobody knows if you're a dog — or an accomplished scholar.
  Content on Wikipedia *must* stand on its own, without an appeal to your (or a 
  student's) expertise. A critical reader will want to find citations for any claim made in an article.


  Wikipedia is built on secondary sources writing about a primary source. 
  Wikipedia is not a place to publish conclusions, or to synthesize ideas. In the context of
  Wikipedia, that's called "original research." Wikipedia isn't a place for that kind of 
  research. It’s a place to summarize what reliable sources have previously written about the topic.


  Some instructors find success in assigning students to write an
  encyclopedia-style article for Wikipedia, and then to use that research as the
  basis for a second, offline, traditional analytical paper.
