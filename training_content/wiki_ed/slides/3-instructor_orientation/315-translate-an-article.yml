title: "Translate a Wikipedia article"
summary:
content: |
  Non-English versions of Wikipedia have great content that's missing on English
  Wikipedia, and vice-versa. In a translation assignment, students identify
  high-quality articles on the language they are studying to translate to
  English Wikipedia. Non-native English speakers can translate an article from
  English into their native language. Some instructors in advanced (e.g.,
  graduate) courses add an additional step and ask students to
  fact-check original sources before translating it to the target-language
  Wikipedia article.

  Timeline: 4 weeks (minimum)

  Suitable for:
  * Foreign language courses
  * Translation studies courses
  * Students with native fluency in the language Wikipedia they will edit
  * Courses with fewer than 30 students

  Student learning outcomes:
  * Writing and communication skills
  * Translation skills
  * Foreign language skills
  * Media and information literacy
  * Collaboration
