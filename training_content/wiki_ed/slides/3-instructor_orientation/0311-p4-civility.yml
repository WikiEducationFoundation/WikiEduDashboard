  Civility is a core tenet of Wikipedia. Unfortunately, online text is
  notoriously difficult to assess for tone or emotional nuance. Encourage
  students to “assume good faith” on the part of others. When a student’s work
  is questioned or removed, they should work with the Wikipedian who edited
  the information to reach a consensus for moving forward.

  Every article has a Talk page where Wikipedia editors discuss changes. This
  is where students can propose edits, ask questions, and get feedback.

  While unresolvable conflicts between students and other editors are extremely rare,
  they can happen. If conflict arises, discuss details on the Talk page. There are also
  Wiki Ed staff who will be assigned to your class to help. You or students can reach out
  to these Wikipedia Experts at any time (we'll introduce them later on).
