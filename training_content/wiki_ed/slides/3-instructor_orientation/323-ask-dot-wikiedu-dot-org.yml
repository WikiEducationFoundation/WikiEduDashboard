  Now, and throughout your course, you may have additional questions. We've
  developed an FAQ compendium where you can easily find
  answers from Wiki Education staff.

  When you or a student has a question, the fastest way to get an answer is to use the
  "ask a question" search bar at the top of the Dashboard. You can peruse
  existing questions and answers, and if you don't find what you're looking for,
  use the "Get Help" button on your course page to get in touch with Wiki Education staff.
