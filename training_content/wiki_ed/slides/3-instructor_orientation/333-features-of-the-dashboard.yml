  During the term, students will follow the steps to learn how to edit Wikipedia
  without needing much time during lecture hours dedicated to technical details
  about Wikipedia. After all, Wikipedia is simply the tool students are using to
  learn about the course topic and develop new skills.

  The Dashboard is not just a tool for students. You'll use it to track
  progress, assess each part of the assignment, and view their contributions to
  Wikipedia. Wiki Education staff use the Dashboard to identify students on
  Wikipedia, monitor their drafts, and flag potential problems. In other words,
  we cannot support your students if they don't enroll on the Dashboard, which
  is why it's required to join our program.

  We'll review Dashboard features later in this orientation, right before you
  create your course page. For now, know the Dashboard operates as the central
  hub for your Wikipedia assignment.
