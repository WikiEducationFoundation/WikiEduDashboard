title: Notability

content: |
  Wikipedia isn’t meant to be a catalogue of everything that’s ever existed, so
  the Wikipedia community has standards for whether a topic can have its own
  article. Generally speaking, a topic is considered notable if it can be
  supported by 2-3 independent and verifiable sources. Wikipedia is only as good
  as the sources that comprise it. Emphasize that students should build citations
  into their text as soon as they start a draft, even if it's in a sandbox. Those
  who monitor new articles are sorting through a barrage of spam, joke pages, and
  self-promotion. They will quickly review a page for sources that establish
  notability. As long as citations to reputable sources accompany each claim,
  others are unlikely to challenge whether the article belongs.

  Students need to compile a bibliography well before they do the bulk of the
  assignment. We strongly recommend you require students to identify sources early
  on. If the topic they originally selected isn't covered by at least **three robust
  sources**, they should revise their choice. The overwhelming majority of our
  students work on existing articles, and thereby do not need to address the issue
  of notability.

  Wikipedia's notability requirements are often a topic of debate within the editing
  community. Wikipedia's notability policy often excludes traditionally
  under-represented and marginalized populations, thereby perpetuating knowledge
  inequities. Discussing Wikipedia's notability policies is a great way to engage
  your students and to help them think about knowledge construction, bias, and the
  limits of Wikipedia.
