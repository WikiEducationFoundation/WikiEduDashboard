title: Notability
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia isn’t meant to be a catalogue of everything that’s ever existed, so
  the Wikipedia community has standards for whether a topic can have its own
  article. Wikipedia is only as good as the sources that comprise it. Emphasize
  that students should build citations into their text as soon as they start a
  draft, even if it's in a sandbox. Those who monitor new articles are sorting
  through a barrage of spam, joke pages, and self-promotion. They will quickly
  review a page for sources that establish notability. As long as citations to
  reputable sources accompany each claim, others should not challenge whether
  the article belongs.

  Students need to compile a bibliography well before they do the bulk of the
  assignment. We strongly recommend you require students to identify sources
  early on. If the topic they originally selected isn't covered by at least
  **three robust sources**, they should revise their choice. Students may want
  to select existing, short articles ("stubs") for their Wikipedia assignment,
  as another Wikipedia editor has already established notability on the topic.
