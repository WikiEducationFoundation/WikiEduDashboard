title: Avoiding edit conflicts
content: |
  If you are collaborating with another Fellow in your sandbox or in
  theirs, you may encounter what is called an “edit conflict”.

  Wikipedia doesn't handle multiple people editing from different devices
  at the same time very well. An edit conflict happens when more than one
  user attempts to publish an edit while another is also editing the page.
  Make small edits and publish them often to avoid conflicts.
