title: How to find a sandbox
content: |
  To find your sandbox, click the **Sandbox** link, which can be found at
  the top right of Wikipedia whenever you're logged in.

  To find another user's sandbox, navigate there from the **Editors** tab
  of your Dashboard page. You can also share your sandbox URL with someone
  else, who will be able to see all that you've drafted there.
