summary:
content: |
  Every item is known by its **Q-number** as a unique identifier, and labeled in
  different languages and variations. Wikidata records 220 variations of the
  former Libyan leader's name, but because they're all tied to a single Q number,
  there's no confusion.

  Machine-readability also allows bots to edit Wikidata.
