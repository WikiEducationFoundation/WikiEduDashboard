summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia presents information in a plain language format that's easy to read
  but difficult to query. Comparisons across a whole range of articles is
  especially difficult.

  You can read about Marie Curie's occupations in a sentence on Wikipedia.

  Her Wikipedia biography says:

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">Marie Skłodowska Curie (born Maria Salomea Skłodowska; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.</p>

  If we want to translate this into Wikidata, we select an item, Marie Curie,
  about whom we can make a variety of statements. For example: Marie Curie was
  a physicist, she was a chemist, and she worked on radioactivity.

  | **item** | **property** | **value**  |
  | :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
  | Marie Curie | occupation | physicist |
  | Marie Curie | occupation | chemist |
  | Marie Curie| field of work | radioactivity |


  Where Wikipedia is great at capturing the context around the subject of an
  article, Wikidata is designed to express facts.
