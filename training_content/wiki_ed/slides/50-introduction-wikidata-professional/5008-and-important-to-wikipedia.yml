  Wikipedia exists in more than 300 languages, each with its own unique articles.
  There are countless articles that exist in one language, but not another.
  Wikidata, on the other hand, is language-agnostic.

  For example the University of South Africa has individual Wikipedia articles
  in more than 20 languages. As enrollment changes from year to year, information
  needs to be updated on each Wikipedia language version or it will quickly go
  out of date. If each Wikipedia language version pulls information from a
  single Wikidata item, the data needs to be updated only once, and the person
  updating it doesn't need to be comfortable with all — or any — of the languages
  used in the various Wikipedia language versions where the article appears. If
  all the versions pulled enrollment data from the same place, then all the
  versions would be up-to-date (as long as Wikidata's values are up-to-date).

  The structure of Wikidata also makes it easier to identify gaps in certain
  language Wikipedias and allows the article-creation process to happen faster
  by calling data from a central location.

  Since data on Wikidata is centralized, users from any language can add to and
  access it. This has implications for equity, collaboration, and access on a global scale.
