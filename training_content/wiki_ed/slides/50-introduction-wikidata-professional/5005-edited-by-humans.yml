title: "Read and edited by humans..."
summary:
content: |
  Unlike some databases, everything on Wikidata is stored in a way that can be
  read and understood by humans.

  It's also editable - you can click the “edit” button to make changes to the database!

  Behind the scenes, there's a community of people who make contributions to
  Wikidata. We'll talk more about this community later on.
