title: "The Wikidata community"
summary:
content: |
  Wikidata is supported by a community of people who contribute facts to
  Wikidata, create new items, build tools, develop rules and policies, and build
  ontologies. We'll talk more about the community in a later training module,
  but it's important to keep in mind that there are real people behind what you
  see on Wikidata.
