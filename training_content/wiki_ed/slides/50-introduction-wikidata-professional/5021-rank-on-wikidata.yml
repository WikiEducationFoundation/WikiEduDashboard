  The final element in Wikidata is **rank**. Ranks allow for setting a preference
  among multiple values that apply to the same property. You would use ranks for
  changes in population, reoccurring events, or if there is conflicting data
  about a value. Wikidata expresses *preferred rank* with the up arrow, as you
  can see in the image above. The middle circle indicates *normal rank* and the
  down arrow means *deprecated rank*. Wikidata has values for decades of life
  expectancy statistics in Uruguay.  The image shows the preferred rank for life
  expectancy of Uruguay from a few years ago.
