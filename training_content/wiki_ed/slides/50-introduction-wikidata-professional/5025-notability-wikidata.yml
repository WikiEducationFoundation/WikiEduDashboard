title: "Notability"
summary:
content:
  To be included in Wikidata, items need to meet the project's criteria for
  inclusion. The term "notability" is inherited from Wikipedia, where it has a
  more restrictive meaning.

  If the item you're trying to describe actually exists — either materially or
  conceptually — and it can be clearly distinguished from similar items, and you
  can have reliable sources that you can use to describe it, then it probably
  meets the criteria for inclusion. Recall that you need to be able to describe
  the item using the item-property-value triples, and you need sources to support
  those statements. If you're having a problem finding sources for something, it
  may not be a viable item.

  Items that fill a structural role on Wikidata are also allowed, even if you
  don't have sources that describe them in any depth. For example, you may not
  be able to find any information about a person beyond the fact that they're
  listed as the author of three books which have items. Creating an item for
  that author fills a structural need because it makes it possible for queries
  to connect those three books together.
