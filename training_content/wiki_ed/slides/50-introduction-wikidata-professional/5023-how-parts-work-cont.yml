  **Note**: This page documents the classification of this item, which helps to
  place it within a hierarchy and distinguish it from other items like
  "geographic region" or "territorial entity".

  The "Discussion" tab also serves as the editorial space for every item where
  editors can talk about how to best describe that item or property.

  If you are familiar with editing Wikipedia, the "Discussion" tab is equivalent
  to a "talk page".
