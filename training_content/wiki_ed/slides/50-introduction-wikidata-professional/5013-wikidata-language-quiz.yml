        Each language has its own, independent set of facts just like Wikipedia.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Although users can choose from over 300 languages to view Wikidata,
        all languages use and see the same data.

        Entries to Wikidata are in English, but the labels should be translated by hand
        into other languages.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! You can view Wikidata entries in any language. Labels are
        tied to the language you use to read Wikidata.

        You can work in the language of your choice since the underlying data
        is independent of your Wikidata language preference.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! This is one of the most exciting things about Wikidata - since
        it's language-agnostic, you can easily switch between languages and
        enter data in any language you like.

        To contribute to Wikidata you need to be able to speak all the languages
        used in the project.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! That would be very cool, but is not necessary.
