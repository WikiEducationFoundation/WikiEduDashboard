      Identifiers are located at the bottom of a page. They link out to other databases that refer to the same concept, organization or person.

  A very common kind of property is an **identifier**. Identifiers are unique,
  standardized ways of referring to specific items from other databases that
  explicitly represent specific items: names, organizations, concepts, etc. You
  may be familiar with Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), Library of
  Congress Authority ID, or Freebase ID as common identifiers. These are important
  because you can link several IDs to the same Wikidata item to associate people,
  concepts, and things across different databases or catalogs. (Wikidata has
  more than 700 authority control identifiers as of 2019.)

  Identifiers can also include accession numbers, stable URIs (Uniform Resource
  Identifier encompass URLs and refer to a specific things instead of just web
  addresses), authority control, and catalog identifiers.
