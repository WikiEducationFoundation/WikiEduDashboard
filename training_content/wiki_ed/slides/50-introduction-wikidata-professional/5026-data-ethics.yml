  Wikidata is a powerful resource that connects data from all over the world.
  Since Wikidata is open to everyone, anyone can use the data on Wikidata as
  they see fit. When aggregating and linking data, it is important that we
  strive to use the insights that these data produce for good purposes.

  Wikidata presents facts. These facts *should* contain references. Although you
  may not agree with a source someone uses, as long as a fact is added that is
  cited to a source it is okay to add.

  Some examples of facts **not** to include:

  * Sensitive personal information (especially for living persons)
  * Information irrelevant to that item

  **Note**: These rules also apply on Wikipedia.

  Although Wikidata has tens of millions of items, they mostly reflect what is
  on Wikipedia. This means that the same biases that exist on Wikipedia exist on
  Wikidata as well. As you explore Wikidata you may notice glaring gaps. Wikidata
  is neither exhaustive nor complete. There is a lot more to add, connect, and
  clean up.
