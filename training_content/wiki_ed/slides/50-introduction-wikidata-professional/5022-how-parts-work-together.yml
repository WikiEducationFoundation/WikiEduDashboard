title: "How do these parts work together?"
summary:
content: |
  Linked data on Wikidata describe things (individuals, organizations, events,
  concepts) and how they relate to each other. These connections are what make
  it easy to discover items and associate them with other things.

  If you aren't sure how a property works, you can always click on the
  "Discussion" tab at the top of a page to learn more. Here is the "Discussion"
  tab for the Capital property, <code>P36</code>.
