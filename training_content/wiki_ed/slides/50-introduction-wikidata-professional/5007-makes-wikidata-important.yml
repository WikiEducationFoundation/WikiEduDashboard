title: "This makes Wikidata important to the internet..."
summary:
content: |
  Machine-readability allows digital assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google) and bots
  to add and pull information from Wikidata and present it to their users.
  Human-readability allows people to do this as well.

  This can make data from libraries, cultural institutions, and civic organizations
  more accessible.

  Since Wikidata uses a CC0 license, a lot of companies developing AI use Wikidata
  as part of their AI's knowledge base. Just as you can think of Wikipedia as an
  encyclopedia of encyclopedias, you can think of Wikidata as a database of
  databases. Other databases are linking their items to Wikidata items though
  identifiers (more on those in a few slides), allowing more than 700 other
  databases to help describe items. This creates a centralized location of
  information about the same concepts, things, or people.
