  Wikidata contains over 50 million **items** which are described by properties
  with values. An item is a thing, concept, or entity (like a country, a person,
  a book, a point in time, a philosophy, or a process). Items are represented
  with the letter Q followed by a number. For example the country Uruguay's
  item number is <code>Q77</code>.

  **Note**: You do not have to memorize Q item numbers.

  Items have **labels** which identify the items in terms that humans can understand.
  Items have labels in multiple languages. The label you see depends on the
  language settings on your browser. Items also have **descriptions**, which explain
  what that item is (in more than 300 languages). Items also have **aliases**, which
  are alternative names for items (for example "Uruguay" could also be "the
  Republic of Uruguay", or remember the example from a few slides ago of the
  former Libyan leader).

  **Note**: If the item you're looking at does not have a label in the
  language you're using, it will show up as that item's Q-number. To add a
  label in that language, just click "edit" and add the label in that language!
