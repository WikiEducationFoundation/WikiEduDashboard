content: |
  Wikidata is a document-oriented database. Facts are stored as structured data
  within documents. Each document is indexed by a unique identifier, the Q-number,
  which distinguishes it from every other document in the database. This format
  allows for detailed, expressive querying, and makes the data machine-readable.

  At the heart of each document is the **statement**, a three-part structure
  that connects an **item**, a **property** and a **value**.
