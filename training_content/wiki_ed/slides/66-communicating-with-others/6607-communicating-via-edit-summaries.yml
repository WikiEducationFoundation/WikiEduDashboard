title: Edit summaries
content: |
  Another way we communicate on Wikipedia is by writing edit summaries. An edit
  summary is how Wikipedians publicly explain why they made a change to an
  article. 

  When you publish a new edit, you’ll be prompted to write an edit summary to
  briefly share what you changed and why. You can read an article’s edit summaries to understand previous changes to the article made by others.

  Click on the article’s “View history” tab to view the history of its edit
  summaries.
