  conversations about the article and how to improve it.

  to get a sense of the ongoing discussions.

  Talk pages are a good place to introduce your plans to improve that article.
  Wikipedians who are interested in the article may engage and try to help.

  That said, you don't have to wait for permission to make changes to the article.
