content: |
  If someone leaves a message for you or pings you with a question on an
  article Talk page, be sure to respond to them. If you are not mentioned
  but have something to contribute to the discussion, go ahead!

  You'll see [reply] linked after each post on the Talk page â€” click on
  [reply] to respond to their post.

  To make sure a specific editor sees your reply, you can "ping" their username
  using the @ symbol.

  When you're done, click on the blue Reply button beneath the text to post
  your reply.

  The Reply tool automatically adds your username signature to the end of your
  message.
