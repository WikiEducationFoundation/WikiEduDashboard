  When someone leaves a message on your user Talk page, an orange bar appears
  in the upper right corner: “You have a new Talk page message”. 

  Click the orange bar to view the message on your user Talk page.

  To reply to messages on your user Talk page, click [reply] at the bottom of
  the message – just like you would for a message on an article Talk page.
