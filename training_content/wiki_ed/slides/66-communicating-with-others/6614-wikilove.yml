title: "Wikilove - a fun way to say “thanks” and “well done”!"
content: |
  To send someone a general “thank you” for doing a good job on Wikipedia,
  click the heart button at the top of an editor’s user Talk page to leave
  something called a “Wikilove” message.

  When you click on the heart button, you can select an icon called a barnstar
  (a traditional form of praise on Wikipedia), a cup of tea, a kitten, or one
  of the many other quirky and fun “messages” you can send to an editor to
  recognize their good work.
