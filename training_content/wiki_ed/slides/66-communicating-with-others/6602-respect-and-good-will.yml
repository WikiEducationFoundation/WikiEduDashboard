title: Respect and good will
content: |
  Before we talk about where we can communicate with other editors on Wikipedia,
  it’s important to remember how we should communicate with our fellow Wikipedians.

  For any interaction on Wikipedia, be sure to always use a respectful and neutral
  tone. Remember, while you may be working on one particular article, it’s not
  *your* article. Everything on Wikipedia is collaboratively edited by everyone,
  which means there is no ownership over articles.

  Whether you are replying to a message, starting a new discussion, or writing
  an edit summary to explain why you made a change to an article, always lead
  with respect and good will for others.

  Now, let’s learn *where* we can talk to others on Wikipedia.
