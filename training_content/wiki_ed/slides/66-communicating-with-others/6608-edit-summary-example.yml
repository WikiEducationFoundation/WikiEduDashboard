  Maybe you added to an article, but forgot to include a source.
  Another Wikipedian might revert (undo) your edit and leave an edit summary
  that says "*reverted unsourced addition*" to explain why they undid your edit.

  Now you know to fix the problem! Simply include the source for your addition
  to the article. For more complicated issues, start a conversation on the
  articleâ€™s Talk page with the editor who made the change (in this example, by
  reverting your edit).
