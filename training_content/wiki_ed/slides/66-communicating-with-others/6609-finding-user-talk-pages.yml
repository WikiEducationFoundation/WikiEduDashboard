title: User Talk pages
content: |
  Just like articles each have their own Talk pages where Wikipedians can
  communicate with each other, each editor on Wikipedia also has their own
  personal user Talk page.

  You can visit another editor’s user Talk page to communicate with them
  directly and leave a message just for them. Click on “Talk” to visit an
  editor’s user Talk page.
