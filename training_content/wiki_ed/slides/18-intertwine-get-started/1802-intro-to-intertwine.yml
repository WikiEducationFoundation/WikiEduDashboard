  To connect you with other students editors, you’ll be using Intertwine -- a platform where you can talk and work together with them. 

  Below is what Intertwine looks like. It features: 

  * Video screens on the left
  * A collaborative notepad you can use to share links and keep track of ideas on the top-right
  * A “slide deck” that contains instructions for the session. You can navigate forward and backwards by clicking the arrows.
