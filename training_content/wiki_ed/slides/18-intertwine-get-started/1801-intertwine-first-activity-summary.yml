content: |
  You will meet with students enrolled in other Wiki Education courses in a video conference using Intertwine collaborative software (For information on the software, check out our <a href="https://mentorhub-app.herokuapp.com/faq-contact">FAQ</a>!)

  Together with them, you will create your Wikipedia User Page (including advanced tricks like adding an “info box”!) and communicate with other Wikipedians through User Talk Pages.

  Don’t worry if you are not yet familiar with some of the Wiki terminology. We have included detailed instructions in the session to ensure the best outcomes, and you can of course exchange help with peers.
