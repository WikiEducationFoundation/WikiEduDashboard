content: |
  You will meet with students enrolled in other Wiki Education courses in a video conference using Intertwine (more about this next page!) 

  Together with them, you will create your Wikipedia User Page (including advanced tricks like adding an “info box”!) and communicate with other Wikipedians using User Talk Pages. 

  Don’t worry if you are not familiar with some of the Wiki terminology now -- we have included detailed instructions in the session to ensure the best outcomes, and you will of course exchange help with peers.
