content: |
  Our staff and blog following would be thrilled to hear from you about your
  experience in this course!

  Here are some questions that may help you to frame your blog, but don't feel
  like you need to answer these:

  * What were your motivations for participating in the course?
  * What articles/topics did you focus on?
  * What surprised you about Wikipedia?
  * What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
  * Did you have any interesting interactions with the community?
  * Why should academics and subject-matter experts contribute to Wikipedia?
  * What advice would you give to other academics/experts learning to edit Wikipedia?
  * Will you continue editing?
  * The length is flexible. Somewhere between 400-1,200 words is ideal.

  The blog post will appear on wikiedu.org and will be Creative Commons licensed.
  We won't be posting them all at once, of course, so if you would like to take
  some extra time just let me know.
