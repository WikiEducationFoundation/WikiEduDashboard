title: "Getting started"
summary:
content: |
  To get started, open a link to <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/">Wikidata's Query Service</a>
  in a separate browser tab. During this training,
  it's best if you go back and forth between this tab and that one, so that you
  can try what we discuss here.

  When you open that link, you should see something like this:

  <figure class="alt-layout-100">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Wikidata_query_service.png" />
    <figcaption class="image-credit">
      This is Wikidata's Query Service (WDQS).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  Up at the top of the page there's a button labeled **Examples**. If you don't see
  it, look for a folder icon. It should appear on the left side of the screen
  or up at the top toward the left. These will lead you to query **Examples**, which 
  will give you access to a variety of sample queries that you can use to learn
  about SPARQL. For now, there's no need to master SPARQL; even very experienced
  Wikidatans just modify existing queries to find the information they want.

  Let's explore one of these examples together in the next slide.
