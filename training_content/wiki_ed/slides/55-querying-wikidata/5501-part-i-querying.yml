  You can read a Wikidata item about a particular person and learn key bits of
  information about them, but as a human (<code>Q5</code>) it's usually easier
  to access and piece together that information from a Wikipedia article. There
  are tools that make Wikidata items easier to interpret
  (<a href="https://reasonator.toolforge.org/">Reasonator</a> and
  <a href="https://sqid.toolforge.org/#/">SQID</a> are some tools that Wikidata's
  information easier to read), but the power of Wikidata doesn't come from
  reading entries. The real power of Wikidata comes from queries.

  In this training module, we'll explore the world of Wikidata queries.
