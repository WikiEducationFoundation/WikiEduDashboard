        Type in a question like you would with a search engine. I can type
        "give me a list of cats", for example.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! The query service uses SPARQL, a query language, which means
        you must use the query language to run a successful query.

        I know SQL and that's a query language, so I can use SQL!
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Although SQL is a query language, it is not the same as SPARQL,
        which is what Wikidata Query Service uses to retrieve information from Wikidata.

        I need to use SPARQL to write a query using variables, specific properties,
        and items in the correct syntax.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! SPARQL is particular and you must express queries explicitly.
        You can express <code>show me all items that are an instance of a house cat</code> as
        <code>?item</code> <code>P31</code> <code>Q146</code>. Recall that SPARQL
        syntax also requires a SELECT statement and WHERE clause and prefixes
        (<code>wdt:</code> for properties and <code>wd:</code> for items), in order for the query to run.

      text: |
        I'll use variables like ?item ?cat ?list.
      explanation: |
        Close! This is starting to look like some SPARQL variables, but SPARQL
        requires you to be very clear and follow an explicit syntax. Review this
        training to ensure you understand some basic ways to form queries using
        SPARQL.
