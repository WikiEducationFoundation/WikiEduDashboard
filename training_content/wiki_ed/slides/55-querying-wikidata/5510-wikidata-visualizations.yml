content: |
  Depending on what you are querying, Wikidata has different visualization tools
  to represent the results of your queries. Keep in mind to activate some of the
  visualizations you need to query the correct type of data. For example you
  need coordinates to see a map, dates to see a timeline, and images to see the
  image grid.

  To select the different visualizations on the query page look in the
  bottom-left corner and click on the eye icon.
