title: "Modifying queries"
summary:
content: |
  The SPARQL code at the top of the query is pretty intimidating for most people.
  Fortunately, there's a simple way to modify queries. Click on the i icon in
  the blue circle near the top left of the page to open the Query Helper.

      There is a "query helper" which will help you make queries without having to learn SPARQL.

  Let's use this to change the query from cats, to dogs.

  On the Query Helper pane, click the down arrow next to where it says "house cat".
  Type "dog" into the search box, at which point the menu will suggest several
  options: dog (<code>Q144</code>), the domestic animal; Canis lupus familiaris (<code>Q26972265</code>),
  the subspecies of mammal; and Dog (<code>Q755126</code>), the Chinese zodiac sign. Pick the 
  first dog and the list of results (at the bottom of the page) will change from
  all the cats Wikidata knows to all the dogs.

  You've done it!
