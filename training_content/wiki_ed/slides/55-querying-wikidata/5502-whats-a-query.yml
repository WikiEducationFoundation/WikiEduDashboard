title: "What's a query?"
summary:
content: |
  A query is a precise request for information from a database. Since Wikidata
  contains so much information, you want to be sure you are querying and receiving
  the exact information you asked for. Query languages allow you to describe to
  databases exactly what you want (and what you don't want).
