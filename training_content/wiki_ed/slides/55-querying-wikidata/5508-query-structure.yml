  Let's take a look at the query line by line to understand what it's about.

  <code>#Cats</code>

  Anything starting with # is a comment in SPARQL that the query service will ignore.

  <code>SELECT ?item ?itemLabel</code>

  A query "selects" something based on certain rules specified in the query.
  In this case, it's a variable we've chosen to name <code>?item</code>. The <code>?</code> indicates
  that this is a variable. The name is just something you pick for convenience.
  In this case, since we're looking for items, calling the variable <code>?item</code> makes
  sense, and makes it easier for other people to interpret your query (or for
  you to interpret it when you come back later and have forgotten why you did
  what you did).

  <code>?itemLabel</code> is a special kind of variable. It applies a modifier,
  or a <code>Label</code>, to the variable.
