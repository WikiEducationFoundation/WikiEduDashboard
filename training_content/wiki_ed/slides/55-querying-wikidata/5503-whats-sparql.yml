title: "What's SPARQL?"
summary:
content: |
  Wikidata uses a query language called SPARQL (pronounced "sparkle"). SPARQL
  queries allow you to ask very specific questions about information included
  in Wikidata, and to tap into Wikidata's repository of structure, linked data.
  **SPARQL** stands for â€ƒa "**p**rotocol **a**nd **R**DF **q**uery **l**anguage," which is what SPARQL
  is. As for the "**S**"...that stands for SPARQL, rounding out a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym">recursive acronym</a>
  joke. Who knew learning to query would be so funny?

  The important thing to know is that SPARQL is a query language for knowledge
  graphs, which is perfect for linked data.
