title: "Choose an extra article"
content: |
  You have the option to choose a second Wikipedia article to edit for extra credit.
  Before you decide to edit a second article, consider the following:

  * Only choose this extra credit option if you have the time and capacity to fully research and write about a second topic.
  * You may wish to choose a topic adjacent to your main entry to better coordinate your research and writing efforts.
  * Do not leave this to the end of the course. Youâ€™ll need enough time to properly research and write your contribution for both entries.
