title: Translation case study
summary:
content: |
  In this case study, we'll briefly review a typical translation assignment. You
  can adjust or adapt what you see here for your own course.

  English Wikipedia is just one of the 280 Wikipedias covering languages from
  Abkhazian to Zulu. The content between these Wikipedias varies, too. While the
  English Wikipedia celebrated its 5 millionth article in 2015, some Wikipedias
  have fewer than 1,000 (such as Abkhazian Wikipedia's 826). But what's shared
  in these articles can vary, too. For example, the Japanese Wikipedia may have
  information about traditional Japanese art forms that are lacking on the
  English Wikipedia. By visiting, comparing and translating these articles,
  students can build bridges between cultures through Wikipedia.

  Translation courses typically run 4-12 weeks. This case study includes all of
  the options related to a translation assignment, but you can pick and choose
  to omit segments, such as fact-checking the target article in the target
  language, to use less time in your course.

  To simplify this case study, we'll use French Wikipedia as an example. This
  case study examines a five-week course.
