title: "Week 1: Exploring two Wikipedias"
summary:
content: |
  In the first week, students are given a brief overview of Wikipedia and how it
  will be used in the course.

  They're given information about the various Wikipedias, and how the articles,
  and the information within articles, varies between them.

  Students take three introductory online trainings, including a short training
  specifically aimed at Translation assignments, to understand the practical and
  cultural components of writing for Wikipedia.

  After taking the training, students are asked to explore the French Wikipedia,
  and to find highly-rated Articles on the French Wikipedia that don't have
  high-quality complements on the English Wikipedia. (They're shown how to do
  this in the online training module).
