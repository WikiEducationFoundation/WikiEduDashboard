title: "Week 2: Choosing articles"
summary:
content: |
  In the second week of class, students choose two articles from the French
  Wikipedia to translate into English. They post links to their user pages on
  Wikipedia, and share them with their instructor.

  Once the instructor reviews these article choices, students copy the French
  article into their sandbox, and begin to translate it.

  Some instructors will prepare lists of French-language articles ahead of time.
  Some choose to assign the articles to either individual students or to groups.

  Choosing articles in advance helps ensure that your students work on articles
  appropriate for your course. However, choosing their own article gives
  students a sense of ownership, and assures they'll pick an article that
  sustains their interest over the course of the assignment.

  For shorter courses, choosing a section of an article, rather than an article
  in its entirety, may be useful.
