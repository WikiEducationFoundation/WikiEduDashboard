title: "Week 4: Moving to mainspace"
summary:
content: |
  Students can move their translated articles from their Sandbox to the
  Wikipedia "Mainspace." In other words, they make it into a "real" Wikipedia
  article.

  They follow instructions from both their online trainings, class handouts and
  Dashboard timeline to make sure they make the move without disrupting other
  Wikipedia editors.

  With longer courses, this move can be postponed to give students more time to
  work on their translations and articles. Some instructors will ask students to
  contribute to the "live" Wikipedia article from this point forward; others may
  postpone that move to "Mainspace." Moving into mainspace quickly is
  recommended, as it gives students ample time to receive (and respond to)
  comments about their work.
