title: "Week 3: Translating articles"
summary:
content: |
  Students have a quick check-in with their instructor at the top of the course,
  to share any questions they might have about their article editing. The
  instructor can check the course Dashboard to see that some students haven't
  completed the training, and encourages them to do so.

  As students edit, they think carefully about the content of the article, and
  where the facts in the article come from. The instructor reminds students to
  make sure the original French citations are included in their translated
  version. For longer assignments with advanced students, some instructors
  encourage students to evaluate the sources used in the target article. So in
  this case, students check out the cited (French) sources, and decide whether
  they're reliable enough to be included. Since students typically work from
  well-rated articles, they'll rarely find concerns. However, they might also
  look for English-language version of the original sources.
