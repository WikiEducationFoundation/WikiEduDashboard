  You'll see two side by side sections. The first is the original, the
  second is what was changed.

  Spot the difference? The section about “And the Wind Whispered” was
  removed, because it wasn't properly cited to a reliable source.

  You can use these comparisons to see what an editor has done to an
  article you're working on. It's also how you can see what
  you've contributed to an article, even if another editor removes it.
  That's why you should never panic if your contributions get removed!
