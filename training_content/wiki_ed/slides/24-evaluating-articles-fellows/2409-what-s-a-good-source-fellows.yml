title: What's a good source?
content: |
  Information on Wikipedia must come from:

  -   **Independent sources**, that is, those not directly related to or
      authored by the subject.
  -   **Sources known for fact-checking and neutrality**, such as academic
      presses, peer-reviewed journals, or international newspapers.
  -   **Reliable publishers** that represent a general consensus in the
      field.

  If you're going to be editing topics related to medicine, health, or
  psychology (these topics can show up in all disciplines), you should
  take our [student training
  module](https://wikiedu.org/wiki/index.php/Programs_team/Projects/Timeline_revamp/training_text/Editing_Medical_Topics)
  about the more strict source requirements for these topics.
