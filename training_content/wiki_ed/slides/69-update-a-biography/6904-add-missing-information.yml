title: Add the missing information
content: |
  Now it's your chance to practice what you learned in the "Adding citations"
  training. 

  On Wikipedia, click "edit" on the person's article, add the fact from the
  source (remember, summarize the information in your own words, don't
  directly copy from your source!), and add a supporting citation. You
  should try to add at least one sentence, but if the source you found
  has lots of information that isn't in the person's Wikipedia article,
  feel free to add more.

  If you need a refresher on how to add a citation,
  [review the "Adding citations" training](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/sources).

  Click "Publish changes". In your edit summary, describe the fact you
  added, then click the "Publish changes" button again.
