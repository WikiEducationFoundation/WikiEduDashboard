title: Identify a new source
content: |
  Now, you'll need to seek updated information about the person.
  You can start with a search of Google News, or pick another search engine. 

  Find articles about that person that meet Wikipedia's Reliable Sources
  policy. The best sources will be independent of the subject (so not
  the person's own website, their social media, or their employer) and
  known for fact-checking (so a reputable newspaper, magazine or scholarly
  book). You can revisit the
  "[Evaluating articles and sources](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/evaluating-articles)"
  training for more details. Search the person's name, and see what comes up.

  If there's a source that isn't currently in the list of references on Wikipedia,
  read through it. Is there a fact or two about the subject in that source that
  isn't on Wikipedia? Great, you're ready for the next step!

  If there isn't anything new or you're not able to find other high-quality
  sources, go back a slide and pick a different person from the list, then
  repeat this step.
