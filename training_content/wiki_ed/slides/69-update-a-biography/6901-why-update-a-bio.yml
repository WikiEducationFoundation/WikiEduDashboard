title: "Why do this exercise?"
content: |
  Wikipedia was founded in 2001, and much of its content was created in the first 10–15 years.
  That means many articles have good — but dated — information. You can help keep information
  on Wikipedia up to date by adding a fact to an existing article.

  This exercise provides an opportunity for you to practice finding a source that meets Wikipedia's
  Reliable Source policy, and adding information from that source to an existing article,
  including a citation.

  For the purposes of this exercise, we encourage you to help correct Wikipedia's content imbalance
  by improving a biography of a historically marginalized person. Let's begin!
