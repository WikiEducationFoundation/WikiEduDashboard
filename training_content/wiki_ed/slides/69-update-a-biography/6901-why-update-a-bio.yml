title: "Why do this exercise?"
content: |
  Wikipedia was founded in 2001, and much of its content was created in the first 10–15 years.
  That means many articles have good — but dated — information. You can help keep information
  on Wikipedia up to date by adding a fact to an existing article.

  This exercise provides an opportunity for you to practice finding a source that meets Wikipedia's
  Reliable Source policy, and adding information from that source to an existing article,
  including a citation.

  Nearly 40% of all articles on Wikipedia are biographies of people, but many are outdated.
  For the purposes of this exercise, find someone who inspires you and update their entry.
  Let's begin!
