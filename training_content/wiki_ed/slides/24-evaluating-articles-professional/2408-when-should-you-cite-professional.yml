title: When should you cite?
content: |
  In general, you should be citing at least once per paragraph you
  contribute to Wikipedia, but any quotations, hard facts (such as
  statistics) and controversial claims must be cited.

  Basically, whenever you add information to an article, be sure to
  include references.
