title: Elements of quality articles
content: |+
  The best articles share certain qualities, which you can model your own
  work after:

  -   **Detailed lead section**: the overview at the start of the article is a summary that
      is clear and easy to understand.
  -   **Clear structure**: there are several headings and subheadings
      arranged chronologically or by themes, with images or diagrams when
      appropriate.
  -   **Balanced content**: the article covers many aspects of the topic,
      giving more weight to important viewpoints and less weight to fringe
      ideas.
  -   **Neutral tone**: the article is written without bias toward a
      particular point of view, and represents all the different
      viewpoints that reliable sources have expressed about the topic.
  -   **Good sourcing**: reliable sources are cited throughout the
      article, and as much as possible.
