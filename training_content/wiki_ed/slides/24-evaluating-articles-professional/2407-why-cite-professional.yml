title: Why cite?
content: |
  *Everything* you write on Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable
  source.

  Wikipedians are working to create an accurate encyclopedia. Adding
  sources means that your work can be fact-checked by these editors.

  Editors (yourself included) can challenge unreferenced statements by
  adding a `{{fact}}` tag in wikicode, which adds a *\[citation needed\]*
  tag to the statement. Some editors remove unreferenced material on
  sight.
