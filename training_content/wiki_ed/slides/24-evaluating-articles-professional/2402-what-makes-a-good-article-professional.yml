title: What makes a good article?
content: |
  You've probably heard that idea that Wikipedia isn't a reliable source
  of information. Maybe hundreds of people work on an article
  fact-checking and reviewing claims and references. Maybe only one person
  has written it using just one biased source. Or maybe someone has
  gone by and added text to promote their business or a client.

  on Wikipedia is any good at all?

  Let's look at some of the ways Wikipedians evaluate the quality of
  articles.
