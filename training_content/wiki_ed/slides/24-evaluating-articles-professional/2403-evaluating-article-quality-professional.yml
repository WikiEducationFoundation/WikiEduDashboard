title: Evaluating article quality
content: |
  An important tool for evaluating a Wikipedia article is to look at its
  **quality rating**.

  Wikipedia articles are constantly being improved, and all at different
  rates. Some rival the best encyclopedias, but others are out of date or
  incomplete.

  Volunteers will review articles and leave a rating on the Talk page. You
  can find this by clicking “Talk” at the top left of the article text.

  The best articles have been evaluated as “Good” or “Featured” articles.
  These are the best that Wikipedia has to offer, and the rating reflects
  a shared view of many Wikipedians. It can be harder to find ways to
  improve a Good or Featured article, and any major edits should be
  mentioned on the article's Talk page before changes are made.

  “Start” or “Stub” class articles aren't considered as reliable, or
  simply don't provide a very strong overview of the topic. These are
  great articles to work on, because there's lots you can do, and you can
  quickly make a dramatic impact.
