title: Name your file
summary:
content: |
  The image will upload. Enter a unique name for the file, something you think
  someone might search for to find the file. This name will also become the name
  of the page. Then enter a description.

  You should add categories to your image, too. Categories will put your uploaded
  media into a general catch-all page where people can find it. For example,
  "[Category:Bonsai](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Bonsai)" collects
  all the photos of bonsai trees that were uploaded (and tagged) on Commons.
