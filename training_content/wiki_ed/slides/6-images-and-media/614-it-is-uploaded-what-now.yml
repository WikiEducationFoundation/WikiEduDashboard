  When your upload is complete, you'll find instructions for how to use the
  image elsewhere. The name of the page, where you can always find the file, is
  whatever you named the file when you uploaded it (including the file
  extension).

  On Wikipedia, you can add an image to an article easily. You can do this
  through VisualEditor (the "edit" button) or WikiCode.
