        People have to follow rules closely when they use "free license" images,
        or they can be sued for financial damages.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! A free license means the creator is sharing the image with
        others, so long as they follow certain rules, such as attributing the
        original creator. If you don't follow those rules, you could end up in
        court.

        You can share any image you find online, as long as you cite the source.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! You can't upload a variety of photographs, including images
        you take of someone else's artwork, because of copyright. Citing the
        source doesn't give you the right to copy their work, unless they
        specifically say so.
