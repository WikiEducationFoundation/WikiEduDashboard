title: "How do I add an image to Wikipedia?"
summary:
content: |
  Once you've found or uploaded a useful image to Commons, you can attach it to
  a relevant Wikipedia article.

  1. Go to the article you want to add your image to.
  2. Click "Edit" in the section where you'd like to add your image.
  3. When the bar at the top of the page opens, click on the "Insert" tab, and select "Media" from the drop-down menu.
  4. Type in your file name. Wikipedia will run a search for that keyword and file name, and show you everything it finds in Commons.
  5. Find your image (or any image you want to use). Click on it.
  6. You'll see image details. Click the blue "Use this image" button to insert the image into the article.
  7. You'll be asked to enter a caption for the image. You can also click on "advanced settings" to access formatting options.
      * Usually, a photo will go to the right of the article, at about 220 pixels wide.
  8. "Insert" the image. You'll see how it will appear in the page.
  9. If that's alright, click the blue "Publish changes" button at the top right.

  Presto! The image should appear right where you wanted it.
