title: "What about adding my own images to Wikipedia?"
summary:
content: |
  You can certainly create and share graphs, maps, diagrams, audio, and video
  you make yourself. If you create media for any of the following, you can share
  it:

  * Natural landscapes, animals, and plants
  * Public figures and people in public places
  * Objects, so long as they aren't "artistic" (no pictures of sculptures, art,
    or even brand logos)

  Remember, as the creator of the image, you’re agreeing to share your own work
  under the licensing terms we’ve previously described.
