title: If you're unsure
summary:
content: |
  Sometimes, you just won’t be able to find an image that suits your article and
  follows the licensing requirements. It’s always better to upload nothing at
  all than to upload a file that violates copyright or one that isn't relevant
  to the article. Your instructor will understand!

  If you're not sure about whether an image is okay to upload, it's always
  better to ask than to just hope it is. When you upload an image to Wikimedia
  Commons that violates copyright laws, at a minimum, it wastes valuable volunteer
  time to delete images. Egregious violations could get you served legal notices!
  If you're even slightly unsure, please ask for help rather than just uploading it.

  The Wikipedia Expert assigned to your course will be happy to evaluate if an
  image you've found is appropriate for Wikimedia Commons if you're not sure.
  You can reach the Wikipedia Expert by clicking the "Get Help" button on your
  course page.
