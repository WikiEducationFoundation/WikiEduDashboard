  Sometimes, you just won’t be able to find an image that suits your article and
  follows the licensing requirements. It’s always better to upload nothing at
  all than to upload a file that violates copyright. Your instructor will
  understand!

  If you're not sure about whether an image is okay to upload, it's always
  better to ask than to just hope it is. The way you “find out” could come in
  some unsavory forms. When you upload an image to Wikimedia Commons that
  violates copyright laws, at a minimum, it wastes valuable volunteer time to
  delete images. Egregious violations could get you served legal notices! If
  you're even slightly unsure, please ask for help rather than just uploading it.

  The Wikipedia Expert assigned to your course will be happy to evaluate if an
  image you've found is appropriate for Wikimedia Commons if you're not sure.
  You can reach the Wikipedia Expert by clicking the "Get Help" button on your
  course page.
