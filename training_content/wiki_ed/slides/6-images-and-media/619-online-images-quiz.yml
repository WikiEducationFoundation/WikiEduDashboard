        Free image websites are good sources of images for Wikipedia articles,
        because they have a professional quality and don't charge for their images.
      explanation: |
        Incorrect! Free image websites don't always share their images with the
        correct license, and they may not even attribute the creator of the
        images themselves. That makes them an inappropriate source of images for
        Wikipedia articles.

        If the image creator posts an image to an online forum and says "I
        don't care what people do with this," you can use the image on Wikipedia.
      explanation: |
        Incorrect! The creator of the image needs to link to an appropriate
        Creative Commons license in order to use the image on Wikipedia.

        CC Search, with the appropriate filters, is an ideal way to find images,
        because it only shows images that already fit Wikipedia's criteria.
      explanation: |
        Correct! The material that CC Search returns to you will be OK to use in
        your Wikipedia article.
