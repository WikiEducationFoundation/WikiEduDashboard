summary:
content: |
  The first step to adding an image to your Wikipedia article is finding one.
  You can search for images directly in Wikipedia by using the Visual Editor.

  Click “Edit” at the top of the screen. Then, click your cursor into the
  article wherever you’d like your image to appear. Then, choose “Insert” on the
  editing bar at the top of the screen. A few options will pop up. Choose “Media.”

  Try searching for a few different word combinations. You could even try terms
  in other languages!

  Click to choose an image, and select “Use this image” on the top right. You’ll
  be prompted to write a description of the image as it relates to the content
  of your article. Once you insert it, you’ll be given a preview of how it will
  appear in the text. If it looks good to you, press Publish changes” and enter an
  edit summary. That’s it!
