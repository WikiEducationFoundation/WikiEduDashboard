title: Upload a file
summary:
content: |
  How you upload an image will depend on whether it’s your own work, or someone
  else’s.

  In all cases, go to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">commons.wikimedia.org</a>
  first, and make sure you are logged in. Click the Upload button (or "Upload file"
  from the left-hand sidebar).

  ----
  ## If you find an image through CC Search
  Download the image, make a note of the author, and a link to the original source.

  * Select "This file is not my own work" when you begin your image upload.
  * Give the name of the source of the image (a direct link is preferred).
  * Name the original creator of the image (this can be an agency or organization).
  * Beneath that, carefully select the source of the image from the options
    provided, and select the license that matches the way the image is shared.

  If you can't answer these questions, it may mean the image isn't appropriate
  to use. Never try to work around these questions by claiming an image is yours
  if it isn't. That's a copyright violation.

  ## If the work is your own work
  Select “This is my own work,” and enter your username in the blank space.
  That’s all there is to it!
