        A promotional poster for a movie, shared by the movie studio to
        newspapers to promote the film.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. Promotional posters are still under copyright, they just have
        an agreement with media outlets on how to use them. Wikipedia and
        Wikimedia Commons aren't privy to those agreements, so you shouldn't use
        promotional images of movies, musicians, actors or other figures unless
        they are in the public domain or shared under a free license.

        An image you found on a website for free clip art.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. Just because a website says you can use its images for free,
        doesn't mean they allow images to be re-used or re-hosted elsewhere.
        Unless they specifically link to a license that says it's OK to reuse or
        repurpose, you shouldn't use it!

        A picture you've taken of a new painting in the university museum.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. You can't take pictures of copyrighted materials, such as an
        artist's painting. Likewise, you can't upload audio recordings of live
        performances of music.

        A political cartoon from a 150-year-old newspaper.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! You can scan, or photograph, images in the public domain. Most
        likely, an image in a 150-year-old newspaper has fallen out of
        copyright, and could be shared.
