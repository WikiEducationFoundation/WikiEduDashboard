title: "Good work!"
summary:
content: |
  You should feel ready and confident about sharing images on Wikimedia Commons,
  or adding images to Wikipedia articles.

  Here are some take-aways:
  * Never upload images you find through an image search or on Instagram, Tumblr,
  Reddit, Imgur, or even so-called "Free image" or "free stock photo" websites.
  *Try searching [search.creativecommons.org](https://search.creativecommons.org/)
  for appropriate images.
  *Don't just upload an image to a Wikipedia article. Upload it to Wikipedia's
  sister site for images, Wikimedia Commons, first.
