  On Wikipedia, the images you use must have a what's called a "free license".

  Anyone who creates a work is automatically the owner of its copyright, unless
  they produced it for an employer, or transferred their copyright to someone
  else. A free license is a kind of copyright license that says the creator will
  allow anyone to use their work (with some, or no, restrictions) without asking
  for permission.

  Wikimedia Commons — the free media collection that Wikipedia draws from —
  defaults to what's called a "Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike"
  license (CC BY-SA).

  That means that anyone can:
  * use it, copy it, share it
  * modify it and share it as a new work

  As long as the person using it:
  * provides credit to the original author and notes the license (Attribution)
  * releases any modifications of the work under the same license (Share-Alike)
