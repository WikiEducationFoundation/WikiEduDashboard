title: "Evaluate your article"

  If youâ€™re working on an existing article, read the current version and think about
  how it should be improved. Look at the article's content, tone, and sourcing.

  * Is the article's content relevant to the topic? Are some areas under- or over-developed?
  * Is it written neutrally?
  * Does each claim have a citation? Are the citations reliable?
  * Does the article tackle one of Wikipedia's equity gaps (coverage of historically
  underrepresented or misrepresented populations or subjects)?

  What can you add? Consider posting some of your ideas to the article's Talk page.
