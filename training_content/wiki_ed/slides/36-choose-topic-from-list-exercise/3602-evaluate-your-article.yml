  Think back to how to evaluate an article. Look at the article's content, tone,
  and sourcing.

  * Is the article's content relevant to the topic? Are some areas under- or over-developed?
  * Is it written neutrally?
  * Does each claim have a citation? Are the citations reliable?

  What can you add? Consider posting some of your ideas to the article's Talk page.
