  Find an article from the list of "Available Articles" on the **Articles** tab on
  your course page. When you find the one you want to work on, click **Select** to
  assign it to yourself.

  If you're working in a group, only one group member can select your topic from
  the list on the **Articles** tab. Once your group has agreed upon the topic, the
  remaining group members should head to the **Students** tab, click "assign myself an
  article", and copy the URL or title of the article you've chosen.
