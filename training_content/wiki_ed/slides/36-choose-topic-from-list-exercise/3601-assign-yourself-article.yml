  While logged in, click the "Assign myself an article" button in your
  "My Articles" section on the Home tab. This will bring up a list of articles
  your instructor has selected. When you find the one you want to work on,
  click Select to assign it to yourself.

  Alternatively you can select an article by viewing the list at the
  "Available Articles" portion of the **Articles** tab and clicking Select. If you
  are working in a group, be aware that only one group member can select the
  topic via this method; the remaining group members will need to assign the
  article via the **Home** tab.
