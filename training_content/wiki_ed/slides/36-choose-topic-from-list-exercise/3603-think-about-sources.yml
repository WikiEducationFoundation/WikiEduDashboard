  The next step will be to start compiling a list of relevant and reliable books, journal articles,
  and other sources. You can keep a running list of these sources in your bibliography
  to reference easily when you start writing. Once you've assigned yourself the article, your bibliography
  can be found by going to the **My Articles** section and clicking on the **Bibliography** link underneath
  the article you are working on. Make sure to add your sources there.

  Make sure to check in on the Talk page to see if anyone has posted comments that
  that might be useful as you begin writing. Adding the article to your Watchlist by clicking the star next to
  "View history" will help you keep track of new comments. If you've added your email to your
  account (which is a *really* good idea), you'll get notifications if something
  on the page changes.
