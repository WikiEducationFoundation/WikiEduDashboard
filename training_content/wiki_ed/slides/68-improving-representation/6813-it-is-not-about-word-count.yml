title: It’s not about a word count
content: |
  Remember, understanding your topic is crucial. When you know the
  whole story of a topic, you’ll know how much weight to give each
  section of the article.

  That’s why editing a Wikipedia article can involve adding a few
  words, several paragraphs, or even trimming down text – it all
  depends on what and how much is missing, or whether there’s too
  much information about a minor aspect of the topic.

  It’s not the quantity, but the quality of your edits on Wikipedia
  that matters.
