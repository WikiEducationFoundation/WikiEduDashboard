title: Neutral writing
content: |
  In your first training, you learned that Wikipedia articles should
  summarize the major points of a topic in a balanced and impartial
  manner – just the facts, written in a neutral tone.

  While this may sound simple, sometimes it’s easy to get caught up
  in our passion or deep connection to a topic. As you edit, try to
  maintain awareness of your own biases to prevent your opinions
  from creeping into the text.
