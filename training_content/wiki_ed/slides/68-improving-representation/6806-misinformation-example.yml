title: Example of misinformation
content: |
  Imagine you are looking for information on the contributions of women
  (or another minority group) to the field of chemistry. After reading
  through several related Wikipedia articles, you don’t see many
  mentions of women, so you conclude that women haven’t contributed
  very much to the field.

  This gap in coverage has led you to believe that there haven’t been
  many female chemists, nor have women advanced the field – a
  falsehood.
