title: Notability
content: |
  Just because you know an accomplished person doesn’t mean they
  necessarily meet the notability threshold for a Wikipedia page.
  For a topic to have its own article, it must be covered by reliable
  sources that have no connection to the topic – the article can’t
  cite self-published sources like social media posts, press releases,
  or almost all YouTube videos.

  But when systemic bias exists in areas like journalism, publishing,
  and academia, it can be difficult to find the sources needed to
  improve representation on Wikipedia. So as an editor, what can
  you do?
