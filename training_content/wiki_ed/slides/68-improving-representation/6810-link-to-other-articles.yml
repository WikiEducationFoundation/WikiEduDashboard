title: Link to other Wikipedia articles
content: |
  You can also add links to other related Wikipedia articles with
  representative content, or in article sections like “See also”,
  “Further reading”, and “External links.”

  If you've added information that also belongs in another Wikipedia
  article, you should consider adding it there. For example, if you
  add "She shared the 2005 [Zayed International Prize for the
  Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayed_International_Prize_for_the_Environment) with Emil Salim," you should check to see that this
  fact is also present in the biography of the other awardee,
  Emil Salim.
