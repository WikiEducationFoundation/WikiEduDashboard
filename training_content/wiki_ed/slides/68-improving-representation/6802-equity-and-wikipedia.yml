title: "Equity and Wikipedia"
content: |
  By editing Wikipedia, we’re all part of the knowledge equity movement – the
  idea that everyone should have equal access to create and consume knowledge.

  On Wikipedia, this means increasing the diversity of both the content and
  its authors themselves – editors just like you – because we know that when
  people of all backgrounds add information, Wikipedia gets better.

  As a Wikipedian, you have the power to enhance knowledge equity by
  including perspectives often missing from the dominant story and correcting
  existing misrepresentations.
