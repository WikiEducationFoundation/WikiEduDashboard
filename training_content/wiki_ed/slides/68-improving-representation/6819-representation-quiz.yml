        When you add text to a biography article, talk about how fantastic
        the person is – because you know they are!
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. Write the facts in a neutral tone and cite sources. Even if
        you personally know the individual and how accomplished they are, you
        can’t add information to Wikipedia without citing a high-quality source.

        Add content to an article about a well-known LGBTQ+ advocacy group
        using information from their Instagram post.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. While the advocacy group may be considered notable enough
        for a Wikipedia article, be sure to cite high-quality sources like
        journal articles, books, and newspapers when you add content.

        In articles about women, delete any content related to men.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT. It’s important that the majority of the woman’s article
        focuses on her own story, but that doesn’t mean you must get rid of
        relevant information about the men in her history. Take care to
        give appropriate weight to the different sections of an article.
