content: |
  Just like the world’s understanding of people and subjects evolve
  and improve, so must Wikipedia.

  While your precise wording may not stick (someone else may rewrite
  your sentences entirely), an important part of the process is
  getting these ideas and perspectives into the article.
  Ever-evolving, ever improving – with your help.
