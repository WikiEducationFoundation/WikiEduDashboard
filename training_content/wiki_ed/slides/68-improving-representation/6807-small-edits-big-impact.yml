title: Small edits, big impact
content: |
  But there’s good news, too! We are all capable of improving
  Wikipedia, and even the smallest edits can make a large impact
  on the representation of the voices and subjects often left out
  of the story.

  For example, by adding just 26 words to the article about Kalief
  Browder, an African American teenager imprisoned without trial,
  a student editor just like you filled in critical information gaps
  for readers, including details about his race, imprisonment in
  solitary confinement, and suicide after release – all crucial
  context for his story, which spurred nationwide activism and
  criminal justice reform.
