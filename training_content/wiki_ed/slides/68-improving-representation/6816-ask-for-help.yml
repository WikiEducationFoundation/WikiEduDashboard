  Can’t find what you’re looking for online? Don’t forget – reliable
  sources don’t have to be digital! Ask your professor for tips or
  librarians for help exploring their catalogs of books, academic
  journals, newspapers, and more.

  Since additions made without appropriate citations run the risk
  of being reverted by other editors, always be sure to use
  high-quality sources for inline citations to support the validity
  of the information you’ve added.
