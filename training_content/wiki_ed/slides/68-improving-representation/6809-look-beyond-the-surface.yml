  Adding text to the body of an article can be a great way to improve
  representation on Wikipedia, but there are also many other approaches
  to enhancing equity.

  Be sure to look beneath the surface of the article as you edit. For
  example, you can make a huge impact by finding and adding sources
  authored by women, people of color, Indigenous people, sexual and
  linguistic minorities, and people from the developing world to any
  article about any topic.
