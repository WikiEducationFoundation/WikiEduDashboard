title: Misinformation
content: |
  Wikipedia is the world’s go-to site for knowledge, and when there’s
  a hole in the information on a topic, it can result in misinformation.
  When an article is missing content, or the article doesn’t exist,
  readers are unable to fact check the claims they encounter.

  This allows misunderstandings on misleading claims to stand
  unchallenged and uncorrected, and readers may fill in the gaps with
  their own assumptions.

  We base these assumptions on our preconceptions of the topic and
  any existing biases we have. And even if it's unintentional, this
  can cause us to continue thinking in a way that’s actually not
  true – a false reality.
