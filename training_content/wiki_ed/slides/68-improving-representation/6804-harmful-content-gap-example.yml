title: "Example: the harm in content gaps"
content: |
  For example, when place-based articles about specific towns or parks in the
  U.S. do not include information on pre-colonial Indigenous populations and
  their persistence over time, they erase them from history.

  Photo captions on Wikipedia that reference Indigenous peoples without
  naming the specific tribes fail to accurately represent diverse Indigenous
  nations.
