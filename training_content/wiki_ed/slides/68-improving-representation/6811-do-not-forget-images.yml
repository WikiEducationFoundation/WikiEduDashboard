title: "Don’t forget about images"
content: |
  Improving representation on Wikipedia is about more than just the
  words in articles – it’s also about the images. Even if the
  article’s text is representative, its photo may not be.

  Who is depicted in the image? How are they depicted? Images in the
  public domain are allowed on Wikipedia, but when an image is out
  of date, it can make people or places look frozen in time, which
  negatively impacts the accuracy of and representation within the
  topic.

  The easiest way to adhere to Wikipedia’s image copyright guidelines
  is to take the photo yourself. Remember, if it’s not your photo,
  don’t upload it to Wikipedia. We’ll also take an in-depth look at
  image guidelines in a later training.
