title: Drafting a new article?
content: |
  If your group is creating a new article, it makes sense to get a first
  draft ready in a sandbox. That way, you can get a handle on some of the
  article structure, or develop a lead paragraph that contains everything
  you want to tackle.

  Write an outline of your topic in the form of a standard Wikipedia
  article's “lead section.”

  A “lead” section is not a traditional introduction. It should summarize,
  very briefly, what the rest of the article will say in detail. It should
  include important, broad facts about the subject. A good example is [Ada
  Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). See [Editing
  Wikipedia](https://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia) page 9 for more ideas.

  Note that not all topics pass notability guidelines on Wikipedia, so go
  over guidelines
  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability) before doing
  too much work.
