title: Linking to a sandbox
content: |
  If you are working in a sandbox that is not yours, it can be a good idea
  to link to that other sandbox from your own so you can easily return to
  it. Here's how to do that:

  For example, if you were trying to link to **Samantha (Wiki Ed)**'s
  sandbox in the Visual Editor, type **User:Samantha (Wiki Ed)/sandbox**,
  highlight the text, and then click the **link** icon (represented by the
  chain).

  If you are in source editing mode, linking to another sandbox is as
  simple as adding this code: `[[User:Samantha (Wiki Ed)/sandbox]]`
