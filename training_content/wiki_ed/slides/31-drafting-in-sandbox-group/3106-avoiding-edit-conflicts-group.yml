title: Avoiding edit conflicts
content: |
  Wikipedia doesn't handle multiple people editing from different devices
  at the same time very well. If you're working together in person, one
  person should add the work to the sandbox. If you're all working
  independently, make small edits and save often to avoid “editing
  conflicts” with classmates.

  You can also draft your contributions in your own sandbox and move them
  into your group's shared sandbox when you're ready.

  Make sure that you're logged in while editing in your classmate's
  sandbox to ensure your edits are recorded.

  Don't create a group account for your project. Group accounts are
  prohibited per Wikipedia policy.
