title: Starting a draft as a group
content: |
  Once your group has a Wikipedia article to work on and everyone
  in the group is assigned to that article, you can start your draft.

  Your group's sandbox page will be associated with the first person
  assigned to the article. A sandbox is like any other page on Wikipedia,
  and anyone can edit it. However, stick to editing the sandboxes of
  your group members. Editing another editor's page without permission
  is considered rude on Wikipedia.
