title: Starting a draft as a group
content: |
  Once your group has a Wikipedia article to work on, make sure everyone
  in the group is assigned to that article on the **Students** tab of your
  course page.

  Select one group member whose sandbox space you'll all share to draft
  your article. (It will be titled something like `User:Diderot/sandbox`.)
  Each person should link to that shared sandbox from their own sandbox
  page.

  A sandbox is like any other page on Wikipedia, and anyone can edit it.
  However, stick to editing the sandboxes of your group members. Editing
  another editor's page without permission is considered rude on
  Wikipedia.
