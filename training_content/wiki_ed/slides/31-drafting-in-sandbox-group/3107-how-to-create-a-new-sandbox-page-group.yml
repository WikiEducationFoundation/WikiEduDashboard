title: How to create a new sandbox page
content: |
  The beauty of sandboxes is that you can create as many as you need.
  Create another page off of your user page by editing the URL after your
  username with the name of a new page you want to create.

  For example, to create a new page titled “New sandbox”, first click on
  your username in the upper right when you're logged in. Now edit the end
  of the URL to look like this:
  <code><pre>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Username/<b>New_sandbox</b></pre></code>

  Click **Create source** in the upper right to make the new page.

  If you forget the URL of this new page, don't worry! You can always
  check your **Contributions** history, found at the top right when you're
  logged in, to find it.
