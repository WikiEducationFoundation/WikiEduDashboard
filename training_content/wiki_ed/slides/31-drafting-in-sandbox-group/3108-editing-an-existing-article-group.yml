title: Editing an existing article?
content: |+
  If your group is editing an existing article, a sandbox can be a good
  place to prepare your first updates by copying a *small portion* of the
  article that you want to change or extend. Do not try to overhaul an
  entire article from the sandbox.

  First identify as a group what's missing from the current article. Keep
  reading your sources, too, as you prepare to write the body of the
  article.

  When you're ready to make edits:

  1.  Open your group's chosen article in **Edit** mode. (References and
      other templates will break if you copy from **Read** mode.)
  2.  Select the portion you want to work on — a few paragraphs at most —
      and copy it.
  3.  Open the sandbox your group has decided to work in, and open the
      Edit mode. Now paste the copied article content.
  4.  Add an edit summary that says copied from `[[article]]` with the
      name of the original article, then save it.
  5.  Re-enter Edit mode in the sandbox, make your changes, and publish
      them.
