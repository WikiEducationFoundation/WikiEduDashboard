title: How to find a sandbox
content: |
  To find your sandbox, click the **Sandbox** link, which can be found at
  the top right of Wikipedia whenever you're logged in.

  To find another user's sandbox, go to the **Students** tab of your
  Course page. Click on the tab with the student's username so that a
  dropdown menu appears. Next, select their sandbox from the list of links
  that appears.

  You can also share the URL of your sandbox with someone else, who will
  be able to see all that you've drafted there.
