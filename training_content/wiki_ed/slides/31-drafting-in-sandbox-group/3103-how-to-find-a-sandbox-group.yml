title: How to find a sandbox
content: |
  If you added the same title for your assigned article as the others in
  your group, your course page will provide sandbox links to the sandbox pages
  where you can collaborate. Look for "Bibliography" and "Sandbox Draft" links
  from the "My Articles" section.

  Be sure that everyone in the group uses the same title; Wikipedia article titles
  are case-sensitive, so the Dashboard will only recognize the group if the titles match
  exactly.
