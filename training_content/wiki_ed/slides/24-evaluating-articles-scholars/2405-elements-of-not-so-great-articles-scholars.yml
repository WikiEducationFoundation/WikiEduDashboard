title: Elements of not-so-great articles
content: |+
  Here's some signs that an article may not be so great:

  -   **Warning banners**: Often these banners make a statement about the
      article's reliability, though sometimes it's simply a suggestion for
      improvement. Make a note and read accordingly.
  -   **Fragmented lead section**: A very short lead (or one with a lot of
      mistakes) might indicate that the article was written through
      staggered contributions, and could use a rewrite to tie it together.
  -   **Value statements**: Statements like “the best” or “the most
      important” are red flags that the article is either written to
      persuade or isn't very well referenced.
  -   **Gaps in sourcing**: Are there references to unnamed sources of
      information, such as “some people say,” or “many believe”? If you
      can't answer the question, “Who said that?”, chances are that a
      reliable source isn't cited.
  -   **Under-developed reference section, few citations**: There should
      be a good amount of citations, relative to how much information is
      included in the article. Those citations should be from reliable
      publishers, not questionable websites or publishers with a clear
      bias.
  -   **Imbalanced sections**: Sections about an important aspect of the
      topic shouldn't be shorter than sections about an unimportant
      aspect. This sort of imbalance might also mean that relevant
      sections are missing completely.
