title: Reading history
content: |
  Let's look at what happens if you see someone has made an edit to an
  article you're working on.

  You can see how an article has evolved over time by clicking the “View
  history” link at the top of every article.

  On the “View history” page, you'll see a list of recent changes to the
  article, with edit summaries describing what other editors have done.

  In this example, on the page for Nellie Bly, you'll see that on July 15,
  an editor made a change to the “Asylum expose” section of her article.
  Others left more detailed descriptions. Tom Streissguth added a link to
  an online collection of Bly's newspaper articles, while CutOffTies
  removed an unsourced claim. What if you'd like to see what that
  unsourced claim was?

  You can compare histories between articles by clicking on the radio
  buttons next to each line:

  Then select the “compare history” button at the top.
