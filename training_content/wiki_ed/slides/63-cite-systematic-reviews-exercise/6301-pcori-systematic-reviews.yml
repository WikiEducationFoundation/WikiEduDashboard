title: "PCORI systematic reviews"
content: |
  In this exercise you'll practice adding citations to medical content on Wikipedia
  using [systematic reviews](https://www.pcori.org/impact/evidence-synthesis-reports-and-interactive-visualizations/pcori-ahrq-systematic-reviews)
  produced by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)
  and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which
  analyze existing literature from all relevant medical studies on a topic.
  These kinds of peer-reviewed meta-analyses are great sources for medical
  content on Wikipedia.

  Wikipedia is one of the most highly visited sites for medical information, and
  the community has developed rigorous sourcing requirements to ensure that
  medical content on Wikipedia is accurate, up-to-date, and accessible. PCORI's
  systematic reviews meet these requirements and are a great way to learn how
  to cite medical content on Wikipedia.
