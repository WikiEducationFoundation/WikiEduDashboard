title: "Keep a journal"
content: |
  As part of your Wikipedia assignment, you’ll be keeping a weekly journal.
  Each week, you’ll document your thoughts and experiences as you learn how
  to contribute to Wikipedia. You can use the questions on the next slide to
  guide your weekly entries.

  Note: Wiki Education does not provide a platform for your journal. Ask
  your instructor where you should post your journal entries.
