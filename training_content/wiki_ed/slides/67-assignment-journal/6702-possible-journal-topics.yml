  As you reflect on your Wikipedia assignment each week, consider the following:

  * What were the main objectives of this week’s Wikipedia activities? What skill(s) did you learn?
  * How will these activities help you advance to the next phase of the project?
  * Describe what you found interesting/surprising/noteworthy about this week’s activities. This may include an aspect of Wikipedia you had not previously been aware of, an interaction you had with another editor, something that arose while conducting your research, etc.
  * As you think about this week’s Wikipedia work, describe anything that you found confusing or difficult. This can include any technical challenge you encountered, something that wasn’t clear from the instructions or training materials, an interaction with another editor, or a policy that wasn’t straight forward. Outline how you dealt with these issues. Is there anything you might do differently next time? Do you still have questions about how to proceed? List any relevant links from this week - i.e. where is your assigned exercise located?
  * Think about the big picture: Reflect on how this week’s activities advanced your understanding of Wikipedia and this assignment. Compared to when you began this project, how has your understanding of Wikipedia changed or evolved? 
  * How have you been taught about Wikipedia? How did you use Wikipedia before this project? Has contributing to Wikipedia affected how you’ll use it going forward?
  * Consider your own demographic background. Did this impact your Wikipedia experience? For example, how does your nationality, local geography (e.g., hometown), gender, race, ability, or linguistic background affect the kinds of knowledge you hope to represent on Wikipedia?
  * What role do you think Wikipedia plays or ought to play in the larger information landscape?
