title: Edit an existing article
summary:
content: |
  If you're editing an existing article, a sandbox can be a good place to prepare
  your first updates by copying a small portion of the article that you want to
  change or extend. Do not try to overhaul an entire article from the sandbox.

  1. Open the original article in **Edit** mode. (References and other templates
  will break if you copy from **Read** mode.)
  2. Select the portion you want to work on — a few paragraphs at most — and copy it.
  3. Open your sandbox in Edit mode and paste the copied article content
  4. Add an edit summary that says `copied from [[article]]` with the name of the original article, then save it.
  5. Re-enter **Edit** mode in your sandbox, make your changes, and save them.
  6. When you're ready to move your small updates back into the article, use the
  same procedure in reverse: copy from your sandbox in **Edit** mode, and paste
  the updated content into the article.

  Once you've gotten the hang of it you can make further edits directly in the
  article, or repeat the sandbox procedure one portion at a time.

  If you're working with a new article that you've created, and doesn't exist on
  Wikipedia already, you can "move" your sandbox page into mainspace. In the
  next slides, we'll show you how.
