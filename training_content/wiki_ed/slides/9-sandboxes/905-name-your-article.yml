title: Name your article
summary:
content: |
  Before you move your sandbox article to the mainspace, let's give it a name.

  Think of a good title for your article. Look at similar topics and choose a
  title that matches theirs. Don't use an essay format, or title it with a
  question.

  In fact, your article title doesn't even need to be a sentence. The best title
  is usually the simplest statement of what your article is about!

  * Use natural English
  * Use blank spaces between words
  * Capitalize only the first letter (and proper nouns)
  * Don't omit words
