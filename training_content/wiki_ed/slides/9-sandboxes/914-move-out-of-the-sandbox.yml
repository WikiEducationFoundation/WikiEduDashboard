title: Move out of the sandbox
summary:
content: |
  If you're editing an existing article, you need to merge your updated content
  into the article. The procedure is pretty much the same as what you did when
  you copied material into your sandbox.

  Only copy content you actually updated back into the main article. If you
  copied sections of the article into your sandbox that you made no changes to,
  do not copy **the unmodified sections** back into the live version of the article.

  1. Open your sandbox in Edit mode. (References and other templates will break
  if you copy from Read mode.)
  2. Select the portion you want to move into the live article in mainspace.
  3. Open the original article in Edit mode and add your content into the article.
  4. Add an edit summary that says it copied from your sandbox, and save it.
  (Include a link to your sandbox, like `[[User:Your Username/sandbox]]`, in the
  edit summary.)
  5. Repeat this process for any other parts of the article you worked on.
  6. Copy-edit the article to ensure that your additions mesh well with the
  older content.

  Once you've gotten the hang of it you can make further edits directly in the
  article, or repeat the sandbox procedure one portion at a time.
