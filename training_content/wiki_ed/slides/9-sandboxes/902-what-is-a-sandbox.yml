title: "What's a sandbox?"
summary:
content: |
  A "sandbox" is your personal wiki page where you can practice editing, plan
  out work, draft articles, or just experiment, without impacting the
  article "mainspace” on Wikipedia—which is what we call live articles.

  To go to your default sandbox page, simply click the sandbox link, which can
  be found at the top right whenever you are logged in at *en.wikipedia.org*.

  Think of your sandbox as a replica of a blank Wikipedia article. All of the
  same tools are available for you to use.

  Anyone can still see your sandbox, so it's important that the content you put
  there isn't something you don't want people to see.

  Do not copy and paste things there that might violate copyright rules.
