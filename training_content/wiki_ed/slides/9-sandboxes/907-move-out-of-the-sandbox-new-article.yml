title: Move out of the sandbox (new article)
summary:
content: |
  If you're creating a new article, the process is a little different from an
  existing article.

  With a good title in mind, you're *probably* ready to start moving.

  1.  Do a search of Wikipedia to make sure that there's no article on Wikipedia
  covering the topic you've worked on. (It's possible, though uncommon, for
  someone else to create an article with the same name while you were drafting
  yours.) If there is an existing article, follow the steps in the earlier
  slides to merge your content into the article.
  2.  Go to your sandbox (the "Sandbox" link in the upper right corner, by your
  username).
  3. On the sandbox page where your article is, look to the right. To the left
  of your search bar is a tab called "More." Click it, and then click "Move."

  A new page will appear.
