title: Move your page
summary:
content: |
  The new page will say "Move page." In a big window in the center of that page
  (marked "Move page") you'll be asked for two fields.

  1. First, to the left, you'll see a box that says "User." Click and change it to "(Article)"
  This field is the "namespace". Be sure that it says "(Article)" and **not**
  "Wikipedia"
  2. To the right of that, you'll see a box asking for a title. Write out your
  article's title. Pay attention to punctuation and spelling, because this can
  be hard to change once you make it!
  3. In the "reason" box, enter the reason, something like "I'm moving my
  sandbox article into Wikipedia" will do.
  4. Review your title one last time, and then click on the gray "Move page"
  button.

  You're done!
