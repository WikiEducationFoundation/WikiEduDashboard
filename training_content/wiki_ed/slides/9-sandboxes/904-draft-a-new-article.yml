title: Draft a new article
summary:
content: |
  If you're creating a new article, it makes sense to get a first draft ready
  in a sandbox. That way, you can get a handle on some of the article
  structure, or develop a lead paragraph that contains everything you want to
  tackle.

  You may be anxious, but don't spend too much time editing in your sandbox.
  Being part of Wikipedia means contributing and engaging with other
  Wikipedians, and sharing your knowledge with the world.

  Once you have a few solid, well-sourced paragraphs and a good overview of your
  topic, you should go ahead and move it into Wikipedia proper. In the
  next slides, we'll show you how.
