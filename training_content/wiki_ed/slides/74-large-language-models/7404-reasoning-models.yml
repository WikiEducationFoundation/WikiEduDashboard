title: Reasoning models
content: |
  Newer versions of ChatGPT and other AI tools have wrapped
  additional steps around their Large Language Models. The
  "[reasoning models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_language_model)"
  break up the response generation processes into a series of steps that
  roughly imitate a human's reasoning process, and use an LLM to generate
  a response for each stage of that process. These reasoning models can
  often provide more sophisticated and useful responses, but are still
  subject to hallucinations at every step that uses LLMs.

  Chatbots can also incorporate web searches into the process of generating
  a response, essentially adding the content they find into the context window.
  However, they are still ultimately generating text by using those same
  statistical relationships (heavily influenced by the context window) to
  build up a response one bit at a time.
