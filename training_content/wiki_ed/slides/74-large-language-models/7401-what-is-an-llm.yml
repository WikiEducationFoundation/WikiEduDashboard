title: "What is an LLM?"
content: |
  The core components of AI services — like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini,
  as well as copyediting tools like Grammarly — are
  "[language language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)" (LLMs).
  These LLMs are created by applying statistical algorithms to large collections of
  text — the training data. The models capture probabilistic data about how small
  pieces of text (like words and phrases) relate to each other in the training data,
  and they can be used to generate new text based on those probabilities. When a
  chatbot generates a response, it uses the set of probabilities from the LLM, along
  with some amount of randomness, to pick a plausible next bit of text. It does this
  over and over again until it has generated the full response.

  The resulting text can be surprisingly understandable and believable. The LLMs
  capture enough patterns of grammar, word choice and conceptual similarity that
  generated text can be very hard to tell from human writing. In many cases, the
  text is so plausible that it's easy to imagine it as the result of a thinking
  mind — which is what many chatbot user interfaces encourage us to do. However,
  LLMs are fundamentally not *thinking* or *reasoning* in the ways that people
  do; it's more accurate to think of them as very sophisticated versions of
  autocomplete.
