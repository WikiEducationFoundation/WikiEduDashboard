  AI developers have considerable control over the typical types of responses
  their systems produce, with few safeguards against intentional manipulation.

  In some cases — like with xAI’s [Grok chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok_(chatbot))
  — we know that developers are working to bias their AI systems in particular ways.

  In other cases, researchers study different aspects of [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias)
  in AI systems, but can't easily tell which systemic biases are intentional versus accidental.
  AI companies are subject to tremendous economic and political pressures, but we don't get
  to see how those pressures reshape AI responses.
