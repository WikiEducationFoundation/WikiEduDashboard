title: Effects on users
content: |
  Educators have observed rapid adoption of AI to complete writing assignments
  since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. The development of writing skill is a
  learning process that requires progressive challenges and cognitive effort;
  for most people, becoming a good writer and finding your voice takes a lot
  of time and a lot of work. Using AI to complete writing assignments
  short-circuits that learning process. (Educators’ opinions are mixed on the
  value of AI-driven copyediting tools like Grammarly, from the perspective of
  writing skill development.)

  Researchers are still in the early stages of studying what other effects
  widespread generative AI usage has on the people using it. Because their
  responses are so plausible and flexible — and because they are designed
  to keep users engaged — AI tools may amplify mental health problems, including
  various forms of “[chatbot psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot_psychosis)”,
  as well as simply giving dangerous advice.
