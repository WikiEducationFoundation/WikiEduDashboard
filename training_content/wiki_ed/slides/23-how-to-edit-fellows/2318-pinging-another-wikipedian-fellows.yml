title: Pinging another Wikipedian
content: |
  To get a specific user's attention, you can “ping” them by writing
  `{{ping|Username}}` on a Talk page, which will send them a notification.
  Some Wikipedians have hundreds, or even thousands, of pages on their
  Watchlists so this is a good way to get their attention.

  If you're addressing a user on *their* Talk page, they will be notified
  whether or not you ping them. If you're addressing a user on your *own*
  Talk page or an article Talk page, you'll need to ping them.

  Remember to sign your message!

  If you want some practice, try introducing yourself to another Fellow on
  their Talk page. To find it, go to the **Editors** tab and click on the
  username of the Fellow you'd like to leave a message. Then click
  **Talk** in the upper-left corner of their userpage.
