  Everything on Wikipedia is free to use. So when you contribute information to Wikipedia,
  you need to make sure it's OK to share freely.

  Copying and pasting copyrighted material into Wikipedia is plagiarism. You
  have to attribute facts to reliable sources, but you must use your own words when you
  do.

  It’s also important to avoid “close paraphrasing.” That’s when you take
  another person’s words and make minor changes to their word choices, while
  keeping the overall structure of their writing.

  Finding a balance can be tricky at first. The best system is to make sure you
  really understand the material you’re adding. Think about it, rephrase it from
  a neutral perspective, and then add it (while still citing the original
  source).
