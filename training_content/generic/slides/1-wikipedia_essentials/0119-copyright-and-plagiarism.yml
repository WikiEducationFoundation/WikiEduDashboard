title: Copyright and plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  You might think you know what plagiarism is, and how to avoid it. But
  Wikipedia is a little bit different. The rules cover not only copy-and-paste
  plagiarism, but also close paraphrasing and copyright violations. And the
  stakes are high: the consequences of committing plagiarism in a Wikipedia
  class assignment are the same as handing in a paper you didn't write.

  Plagiarism and copyright violations are disruptive and time-consuming for 
  volunteers to clean up. Except for brief quotations, copying content from 
  copyrighted sources onto Wikipedia is against policy.

  This video lays out what you need to know to avoid these pitfalls!
