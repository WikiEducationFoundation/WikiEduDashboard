  **Notability: “Why this?”**

  Wikipedia isn’t a catalog of everything that’s ever existed. Some topics and
  articles don't exist on Wikipedia because the subject hasn’t been covered 
  enough by outside sources. In other words, it isn’t yet notable.

  When you’re thinking of ideas to write about, keep notability in mind. You
  might be asked why this topic is notable enough to remain in Wikipedia. Find a
  handful of reliable sources early, so you know your article is notable. Then
  you can share them through the article’s Talk page as you get started. (We’ll
  show you how to do this later on).
