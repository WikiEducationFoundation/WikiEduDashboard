title: 'Did you get "patrolled?"'
summary:
content: |
  Sometimes new articles, or editors, are marked as "patrolled." If you get this
  message, don't panic. Though the language sounds a bit severe, it's actually a
  good thing. It means that an experienced Wikipedian has come by and checked
  over your work. Marking the page as "patrolled" lets other editors know that
  you aren't a vandal, or a spam-bot.

  If your page isn't marked as "patrolled," don't worry, either. It's a random
  process and there are thousands of articles to review, so it may not happen
  quickly, or ever.

  Basically: it's not something you need to worry about either way.
