title: Responding on a Talk page
summary:
content: |
  If someone leaves a reply or tags you with a question, you should respond.

  Open up the page just as you would open up an article to edit. Underneath the
  comment you're responding to, type a colon ( `:` ). Each : will indent your
  response deeper into the conversation. So if you respond to a response, use
  two colons, etc.

  It is **crucial** that you sign your messages with four tildes ( `~~~~` )  to
  automatically mark it with your username and a timestamp.
