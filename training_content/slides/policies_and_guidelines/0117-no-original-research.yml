  **No original research: “How do you know this?”**

  When you've written for classes before, you’ve probably been asked to do
  research, come up with a point of view, and then argue it.

  Well, by now you can see that writing for Wikipedia is different. Wikipedia is
  not a place to publish your ideas or conclusions about a topic. That’s
  considered *“original research*.”*

  Your writing for Wikipedia will summarize what *other* people have said about
  a topic you’re interested in, so that a Wikipedia reader can get an overview
  of the current thoughts and understanding of that topic.

  While it may be tempting to connect ideas in a Wikipedia article, you
  shouldn’t make those connections unless someone else makes them in a
  published, reliable source.
