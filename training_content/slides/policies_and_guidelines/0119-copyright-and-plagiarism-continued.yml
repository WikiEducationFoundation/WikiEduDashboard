  Let’s review the forms of plagiarism you learned about in the video.

  * **Unattributed plagiarism**, when a piece of text is copied word-for-word
  from a source and added to a Wikipedia article without citation.
  * **Cited plagiarism**, when a piece of text is copied word-for-word from a
  source, and added to Wikipedia with a citation. Even if you acknowledge that
  the words aren’t yours, you still can’t copy them into a Wikipedia article.
  * **Close paraphrasing**, when a piece of text is copied, but the words are
  changed bit-by-bit. The basic structure of the sentences stay the same. This
  is bad news, whether you cite it or not.

  How do you avoid these problems? The best bet is to understand what you’re
  reading first. Then, take notes that phrase your understanding into your own
  words. Draw from several sources that support your facts, and never directly
  copy a source. Instead, take notes as if you were explaining it to a classmate
  or colleague.
