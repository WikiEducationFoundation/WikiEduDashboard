  **Notability: “Why this?”**

  Notability is an important first step, because it will help you pick your
  topic. So let’s look a bit closer at what makes a topic notable.

  The basic requirement for a topic to have its own article is:
  *significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.*

  * **significant coverage** means that at least a couple of sources talk
  specifically about your topic. Significant coverage is more than a trivial
  mention, though it doesn’t have to be the core focus of the book or article
  you cite.
  * **reliable sources** generally means that coverage comes from secondary
  sources from reputable publishers, ie, written by someone who isn’t directly
  involved in the subject. Note that multiple sources from the same author or
  organization are considered a single source when you’re establishing
  notability. Finally, those sources don’t have to be in English, and they don’t
  have to be online.
  * **independent of the subject** excludes works produced by those affiliated
  with the subject or its creator. For example, self-publicity, advertising,
  self-published material by the subject, the subject's website,
  autobiographies, and press releases are not considered independent.

  Remember, verifiable information on topics that do not meet the notability
  guideline could still be included within articles on broader topics.
