  **Verifiability: “Says who?”**

  Behind every great Wikipedia article are a collection of great sources. It’s
  one of the first things you should do, even before you choose a topic to write
  about.

  That’s because content on Wikipedia must be verifiable. People reading and
  editing the encyclopedia can check its information, see that it is up to date
  and comes from a reliable source.

  You wouldn’t trust everything you read on the internet, and Wikipedia is no
  different. But at the end of every page, you can see where the facts stated in
  the body of the article came from: its source. That helps anyone double check
  facts to make sure that they’re true. When you add content to Wikipedia,
  you’ll want to give the same opportunity to others.

  So, make sure you only share facts that you draw from reliable sources.
  Reliable sources include:

  * Textbooks
  * Literature reviews
  * Books or publications written by experts in the field, and published by reliable publishers.

  Do *not* use:

  * Blog posts
  * Press materials intended to show something in a certain light

  In some cases, such as articles that involve medical editing, newspapers and
  pop-press articles aren’t appropriate, either! (If that applies to you, we’ll
  explore more about this later, in our module on editing medical topics).
