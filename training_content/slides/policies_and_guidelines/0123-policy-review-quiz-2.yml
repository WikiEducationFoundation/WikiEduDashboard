  answers:
    - id: 1

        The subject is famous.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! While this may be true, it isn't required for notability.
        Notability is about the sources that are available about a topic. It
        isn't a reflection of the topic's fame.

        The subject has received significant coverage from reliable sources that
        are independent of the subject.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! Notability reflects the quality, availability, and independence
        of the information you use. You should try to find at least 3-5 good
        sources to help you establish notability for your subject.

        The subject is important, even if it's overlooked.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! It's not always the case that important subjects are also the
        focus of a lot of literature. Unfortunately, Wikipedia can only
        summarize published sources of information. Sometimes that means
        important figures are left out until more high-quality sources are
        available.

        It's a well-written article.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Notability applies the subjects of your articles. It refers
        to the types of information available about your subject. It's not a
        reflection of the quality of your article.
