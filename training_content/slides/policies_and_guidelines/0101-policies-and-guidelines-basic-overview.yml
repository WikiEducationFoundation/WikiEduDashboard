  Welcome to Wikipedia!

  Wikipedia is consistently ranked as one of the top-ten websites on the planet,
  with more visitors every day than reddit, Twitter, or CNN.

  Wikipedia, however, is free, and written by volunteers. And because so many
  people rely on it, it’s crucial that the information they find there is
  accurate. We’re going to show you everything you need to share your knowledge
  on Wikipedia.

  Everything in this training is yours to keep. You can visit any part of the
  training later on through your library page, so feel free to come back
  whenever you have questions.

  Ready? Let’s get started!
