  Prof. Ruppel realizes it’s critical to get the students working "live" on
  Wikipedia early. She assigns students to move their work into Wikipedia, and
  to keep an eye on the article’s Talk page and edit history.


  For the stronger student articles, Professor Ruppel encourages the students to
  write a short summary version to appear on Wikipedia’s "Did you know..." (DYK)
  section, which is seen by everyone who visits Wikipedia’s front page! This
  gives students a chance to show their articles to a wider audience, and get
  feedback from more Wikipedians. It works as a great momentum builder for the
  rest of the project.


  Marguerite tries this out. After she fixes a few issues pointed out by another
  editor, her new article is approved for the Main Page! Marguerite offers some
  help to a classmate, whose first try at starting an article ended up getting
  deleted.
