title: "Week 4: Using sources"

content: >
  By now, the students are pretty familiar with Wikipedia. Prof. Ruppel
  discusses Wikipedia briefly at the start of class. She makes sure students
  connect their assignment to the themes she wants to teach.


  The class has read through a lot of material. They've found a lot of good
  information, but not much of it is on Wikipedia. To practice citations on
  Wikipedia, students add one (cited) sentence to an article.


  Prof. Ruppel reinforces policies around [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Plagiarism).
  This includes subtler forms, such as using shorter phrases without attribution,
  and [close paraphrasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing).
  She encourages students not to rely too heavily on a single source.
