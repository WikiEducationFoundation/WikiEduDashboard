title: "Week 4: Using sources"
summary:
content: >
  The students are familiar with Wikipedia now, so Prof. Ruppel discusses
  Wikipedia briefly at the start of class. She makes sure students connect their
  assignment to the themes she wants to teach.


  The class has gone over a lot of material in its readings, but not much of it
  is found on Wikipedia. To understand citations on Wikipedia, students add a
  short bit of information to an article, citing their readings.


  Prof. Ruppel reinforces policies around [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Plagiarism),
  including subtler forms, such as using shorter phrases without attribution,
  and [close paraphrasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing).
  She encourages students not to rely heavily on a single source.
