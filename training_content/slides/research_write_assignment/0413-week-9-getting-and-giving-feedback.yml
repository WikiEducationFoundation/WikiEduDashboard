  Collaboration is a critical element of contributing to Wikipedia. Students
  hear feedback from Wikipedians with ideas, copyedits, and contributions to the
  students' articles. Others have seen little editing or participation from the
  Wikipedia community.


  Fortunately, a class full of fellow learners is a great pool of peer
  reviewers. Prof. Ruppel assigns students to review each others' full-length
  articles.


  Prof. Ruppel encourages students to focus peer reviews on specific
  improvements. Students are usually hesitant to criticize their classmates, so she
  gives examples of particularly helpful constructive feedback.
