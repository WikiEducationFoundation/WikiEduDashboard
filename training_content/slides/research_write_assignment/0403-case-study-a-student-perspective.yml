  Marguerite is taking Professor Ruppel’s class. Marguerite sees that she’ll be
  contributing to Wikipedia in the syllabus. She knows she’ll be graded on the
  contributions she makes to Wikipedia, among other class assignments.


  There will be Wikipedia content experts she can turn to for questions, and to
  explain things along the way.


  She’s excited about learning more about Wikipedia—how articles are actually
  created and who is in the community—and about having an opportunity to be a
  contributor herself.
