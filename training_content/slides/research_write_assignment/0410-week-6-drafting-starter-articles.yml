  With a good grip on her topic, and a good list of sources, Marguerite starts
  writing her article.


  Prof. Ruppel suggested starting in a sandbox, but encouraged students to move
  to the mainspace quickly. Once on the mainspace, it's "live on Wikipedia."


  Marguerite starts in the sandbox. That way, she can learn Wikipedia's rules in
  a safe environment. She crafts a 3-4 paragraph summary as the lead section for
  the full article, thinking about the overall structure.


  The sandbox stage is an opportunity for an instructor to highlight problems
  and how to fix them. See that students are using high-quality sources, and are
  rewriting information in their own words (rather than copying the sources, or
  committing plagiarism through close paraphrasing).
