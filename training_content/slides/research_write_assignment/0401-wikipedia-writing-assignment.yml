title: Wikipedia writing assignment
summary:
content: >
  In a Wikipedia writing assignment, students create or expand an article on a
  topic that has weak coverage in Wikipedia. They do research, then build a
  well-rounded, well-referenced encyclopedia article.


  In this module, we'll explore a case study based on a 12-week course, but
  courses are adaptable across timelines, contexts, and your course goals.
