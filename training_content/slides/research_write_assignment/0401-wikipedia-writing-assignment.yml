title: Wikipedia writing assignment
summary:
content: >
  In a Wikipedia writing assignment, students find topics that aren't covered well on Wikipedia.
  They research that topic with quality sources, and build up a well-referenced encyclopedia article.

  We'll explore a case study based on a 12-week course, but you can adapt the assignments to be as short as six weeks.
