summary:
content: >
  In week 1, Prof. Ruppel Wikipedia introduces Wikipedia by distributing the
  brochure, â€œ[Editing Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_(Wiki_Education_Foundation).pdf)."
  She also assigned students to complete the one-hour online training.


  Marguerite gets started right away with the student training, and doing a bit
  of simple research to see what she can find on the subject.


  Students who complete the training have better overall experiences. We
  encourage attaching a pass/fail metric to the training on your grading rubric
  (5%-10% is common). You can easily see which of your students have completed
  the training through the Wiki Ed dashboard tool.
