summary:
content: >
  In week 1, Prof. Ruppel Wikipedia introduces Wikipedia by distributing the
  brochure, â€œ[Editing Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_(Wiki_Education_Foundation).pdf)."
  She also assigned students to complete the one-hour online training.


  Marguerite starts the student training right away. She does a bit of simple
  research to see what she can find on the subject.


  Students who go through the training have better experiences. We encourage
  attaching a pass/fail metric to the training on your grading rubric (5%-10% is
  common). You can easily see where students are in the training through the
  Wiki Ed Dashboard.
