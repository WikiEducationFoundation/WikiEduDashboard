  In week 2, students make some basic edits.


  Prof. Ruppel gets her students editing Wikipedia right away. Right now, it's
  just to become familiar with the process. They edit their user pages,
  sandboxes, and maybe do some simple grammar fixes on an article or two. They
  think about what makes a good article.


  Instructors can do this themselves, or contact the teaching and technology
  center on campus to ask for help.
