title: "Week 2: Editing basics"

content: >
  In week 2, students begin making some basic edits.


  Prof. Ruppel gets her students editing Wikipedia right away so they become
  familiar with the process. They edit their user pages, sandboxes, and maybe do
  some very simple grammar checking on an article or two. They also read some
  articles and think about what makes a good one.


  Instructors can teach this material themselves, or contact the teaching and
  technology center on campus to ask for their assistance.
