  Professor Ruppel is teaching a class in Federal Indian Law and Policy. Sheâ€™s
  decided to include researching and contributing to Wikipedia as part of the
  semester goals.


  Professor Ruppel has four course goals. By the end of the course, students
  should be able to:

  * Critique current issues in Indian Country in legal and historical terms.

  * Analyze Indian legal issues from various perspectives and draw conclusions
  based on facts rather than assumptions and stereotypes.

  * Understand the on-going influences and consequences of colonialism for
  indigenous as well as non-indigenous people/s.

  * Recognize the relative nature of all legal systems and apply this to a
  growing appreciation of the ideal of a pluralistic society.

  Using the four course goals as a base, the graduate students will
  collaboratively produce a literature review about Federal Indian Law 
  and Policy. As part of the literature review, the grad students will 
  identify major gaps in Wikipedia articles and content related to the course goals.

  As a result of the review and analysis, the grad students should be
  able to update the article. They should be able to add an annotated
  bibliography of Federal Indian Law and Policy and an Outline of Federal Indian
  Law and Policy (i.e., mapping all the related articles on the subject in
  Wikipedia).
