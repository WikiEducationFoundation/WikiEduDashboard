summary:
content: >
  Prof. Ruppel reviewed Marguerites’ article choices, and gave her feedback.
  Together, they chose an appropriate article for the assignment.


  Prof. Ruppel encourages her students to avoid:

  * controversial topics

  * broad, general topics

  * well-developed topics without much room to improve

  * topics that don't have enough sources to work from

  In class, Prof. Ruppel points out good starting points and practices for
  research. This is a skill useful to their academic careers, not just Wikipedia.


  Marguerite starts collecting a bibliography of material she wants to use.
  Professor Ruppel reviews it, and Marguerite posts it for other Wikipedians to
  see.
