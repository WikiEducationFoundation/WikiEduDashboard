title: "Week 5: Choosing articles"
summary:
content: >
  Professor Ruppel reviewed Marguerites’ article choices, and gave her feedback.
  Together, they chose an appropriate article for the assignment.


  Professor Ruppel encourages her students to avoid areas that are highly
  controversial. Other topics are far too broad, or well-developed, so there
  isn’t much room to improve. Some have the opposite problem. There isn’t much
  information, and not much good literature to help flesh it out, either.


  Good article choices are well established in your field, but weakly
  represented on Wikipedia.


  In class, Prof. Ruppel reviews articles students will work on. She points out
  good starting points for research.


  Marguerite starts collecting a bibliography of material she wants to use.
  Professor Ruppel reviews it, and Marguerite posts it for other Wikipedians to
  see.
