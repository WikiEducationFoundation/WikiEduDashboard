title: A 12-week course
summary:
content: >
  The structure for a 12-week course is flexible. Each week tackles a new topic
  related to Wikipedia. These activities and discussions generally take up a
  very small fraction of your course time for the week, though some
  (particularly at the beginning and very end) benefit from additional time.


  The weekly timeline generally follows this structure:

    **Week 1:** Wikipedia essentials

    **Week 2:** Editing basics

    **Week 3:** Exploring topic areas

    **Week 4:** Using sources

    **Week 5:** Choosing articles

    **Week 6:** Draft a starter article

    **Week 7:** Move an article to mainspace

    **Week 8:** Build the article

    **Week 9:** Get feedback, give feedback

    **Week 10:** Respond to feedback

    **Week 11:** In-class presentations

    **Week 12:** All assignments due
