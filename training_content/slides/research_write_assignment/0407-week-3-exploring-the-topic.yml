  Choosing the right (or wrong) articles to work on can make (or break) a
  Wikipedia writing assignment. Missing or underdeveloped articles on Wikipedia,
  which have ample literature to draw from, can be tricky to find.


  Marguerite explores improvable articles, and posts the most promising to her
  user page. Prof. Ruppel and a Wiki Ed content expert developed a list of good
  'stub' or 'start' articles for students, too. Although this took time to
  prepare, her students could research their articles sooner.


  Others let students find articles theyâ€™re interested in. Students get a
  motivating sense of ownership, but can lead to choices that are further
  afield from course material.
