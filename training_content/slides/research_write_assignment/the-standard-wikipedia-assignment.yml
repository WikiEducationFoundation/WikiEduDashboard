title: The Standard (but not the only) Wikipedia assignment
summary:
content: >
  In a standard Wikipedia writing assignment, students create or expand an
  article on a topic that has weak coverage in Wikipedia. They do research, then
  build a well-rounded, well-referenced encyclopedia article.

  We’ll explore a 12-week course, but courses are adaptable across timelines,
  contexts, and your course goals. Later, we’ll share other assignment types.
  When it comes time to design your course, you’ll be able to pick and choose
  from all of them
