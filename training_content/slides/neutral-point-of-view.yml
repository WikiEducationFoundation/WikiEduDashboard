  **Wikipedia has a neutral point of view.**

  Wikipedia articles should document and explain the major points of view in a
  balanced and impartial manner. Just the facts! Don't debate or attempt to
  persuade readers.

  Of course, facts aren’t always clear cut. Some articles might have to describe
  multiple points of view. In those cases, present each view accurately, with
  context. Don’t suggest that one version of the story is "the truth" or "the
  best."

  This is a big deal. Anything you add to an article should be based on a
  published source of information, and you should always cite that information
  when you include it. (Don’t worry - we’ll show you how later on). That means
  citing published, authoritative sources that people trust.

  In other words, articles should not feature your personal experiences,
  interpretations, or opinions. You reached those conclusions based on certain
  facts. Share the facts you can find in unbiased sources, and let readers draw
  their own conclusions.

  *Tip: If a sentence begins with "This means that...", "I think...," "The
  benefits of..." or something like it, you're submitting something that
  probably doesn't belong on Wikipedia. Likewise, words such as "Interestingly,"
  "Actually," etc, are a form of editorializing, and should be avoided.
  "Interesting" to who? "Actually," compared to what?*
