  You'll see two side by side sections. The first is the original, the second is
  what was changed.

  Spot the difference? The section about "And the Wind Whispered" was removed,
  because it wasn't properly cited to a reliable source.

  You can use these comparisons to see what an editor has done to an article
  you're working on. It's also how your instructor can see what you've
  contributed to an article, even if another editor removes it. That's why you
  should never panic if your contributions get removed!
