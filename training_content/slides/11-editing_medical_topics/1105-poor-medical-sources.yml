title: What are poor sources for Wikipedia?
summary:
content: |
  For medicine, a single research study — no matter how popular it may be in
  newspapers or blog posts — is not relevant for Wikipedia until a medical
  consensus has emerged. This can be difficult for non-scientists to track on
  their own, which is why the medical community on Wikipedia strongly
  discourages the use of primary sources.

  Primary sources are those where authors directly participated in the research,
  or documented their personal experiences. If an author has examined the
  patients, injected the rats, filled the test tubes, or supervised those who
  did, avoid using that source on Wikipedia. This doesn't make it a "bad study,"
  or "bad science." Even top researchers published in top journals should be
  avoided. Instead, use articles that summarize *many* findings from a variety
  of researchers, and report back on findings across the field.

  For biomedical information on Wikipedia, avoid:
  * Nearly all papers published in medical journals (except for systematic
  reviews or literature reviews that examine a wide variety of studies)
  * Popular press articles
  * Blogs
