  This training course will give you a basic overview of Wikipedia’s policies
  and guidelines. It’s important to understand these so you can make meaningful
  contributions to Wikipedia. These are the guidelines volunteers use to
  determine if articles are worth keeping or deleting from Wikipedia. Since you
  want your work to stick, it’s best to keep these in mind as you go about your
  work.

  When you finish, you should be able to answer:

  * What are Wikipedia's core policies and guidelines?
  * What are copyright and plagiarism on Wikipedia?
  * How are copyright and plagiarism handled?
