  Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, but there's a lot of
  collaboration behind every article. You'll work with many people to build
  Wikipedia. To collaborate effectively, you'll want to follow the five key
  principles, or pillars, of Wikipedia.

  Wikipedia's Five Pillars:

  * Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia
  * Wikipedia has a neutral point of view
  * Wikipedia is free content
  * Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner
  * Wikipedia does not have firm rules

  Let’s explore these a bit.
