        Everyone would agree it was true.
      explanation: |
        False! Don’t confuse “consensus” for “verifiable.” Even if you think a
        fact is universally understood to be true, it needs to be cited to a
        specific source to prove it.

        You experienced it first-hand, and you know it is true.
      explanation: |
        False! Wikipedia is not a personal webpage or blog. The facts you
        contribute to Wikipedia need to be verified by experts in reliable,
        third-party sources.

        You remember reading it from a book.
      explanation: |
        False! While you may remember a fact from a reliable, third-party
        source, you need to cite the source so others can reference the same
        material and see if it is accurate.

      text: |
        You found the fact in a reliable source, and can cite that source for
        others on Wikipedia to easily find.
      explanation: |
        Correct! Information should come from reliable sources, and you must
        provide a way for others to check your facts for accuracy.
