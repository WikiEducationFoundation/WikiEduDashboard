  **No original research: “How do you know this?”**

  When you've written for classes before, you’ve probably been asked to do
  research, come up with a point of view, and then argue it.

  Well, by now you can see that writing for Wikipedia is different. Wikipedia is
  not a place to publish your ideas or conclusions about a topic. On Wikipedia, that’s
  considered *“original research.” Of course, you can (and should) do "research"
  in the traditional sense of finding good information in books or through your
  library.

  "No original research" means your writing for Wikipedia will summarize what *other* 
  people have said about a topic you’re interested in, so that a Wikipedia reader can get an overview
  of the current thoughts and understanding of that topic.

  While it may be tempting to connect ideas in a Wikipedia article, you
  shouldn’t make those connections unless someone else makes them in a
  published, reliable source.
