  **Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.**

  OK, maybe this seems obvious. But it be more helpful to think about it as
  telling you what Wikipedia is NOT.

  It’s not an advertising platform, a personal website, an experiment in anarchy
  or democracy, an collection of random data, or a web directory.

  It’s not a dictionary, a newspaper, a book or instruction manual, or a
  collection of found documents.

  Here’s how to put this knowledge into action. When you’re thinking about what
  to share with Wikipedia, ask yourself: Does my contribution look like a blog
  post? An advertisement? A newspaper? A how-to guide? If you've written
  something that looks like those things, something is amiss!
