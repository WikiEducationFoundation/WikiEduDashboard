title: Wikipedia is free

  **Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute.**

  What does it mean to be 'free?'

  Everything on Wikipedia is free to use. That's because everything on Wikipedia
  was written for Wikipedia, by the people who wrote it. Consider it a donation.

  That doesn't mean that anything you put onto Wikipedia becomes free to use.

  Copying and pasting copyrighted material into Wikipedia is plagiarism. You can
  attribute facts to certain authors, but use your own words when you do.

  It’s also important to avoid “close paraphrasing.” That’s when you take
  another person’s words and make minor changes to their word choices, while
  keeping the overall structure of their writing.

  Finding a balance might seem tricky at first. The best system is to make sure
  you really understand the material you’re adding. Think about it, rephrase it
  from a neutral perspective, and then add it (while still citing the original
  source).
