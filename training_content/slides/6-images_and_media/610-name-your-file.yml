title: Name your file
summary:
content: |
  The image will upload. You'll see a thumbnail (sometimes the thumbnail doesn't
  load — don't worry, it's still there!). You'll want to enter a unique name for
  the file, which will also become the name of the page. Choose something you
  think someone might search for to find the file. Then enter a details
  description.

  You should add categories to your image, too. Categories will put your uploaded
  media into a general catch-all page where people can it. For example,
  "Category:Bonsai" collects all the photos of bonsai trees that were uploaded
  (and tagged) on Commons.
