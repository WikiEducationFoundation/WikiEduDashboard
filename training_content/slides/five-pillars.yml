summary: The core rules of Wikipedia
content: |
  Although Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, that doesn't mean that
  everyone can edit it independently. But good articles aren’t written by making
  chaotic, random edits. In fact, a lot goes on behind the scenes of every page!
  When volunteers work on an article, they’re working within a set of
  principles, often called the Five Pillars. There's a system of checks and
  balances in place, too, to make sure that people follow these principles.
  Without this community, there's no Wikipedia. When you edit Wikipedia, you're
  a part of this community.

  Here are the five guiding principles behind how Wikipedia works.

  Wikipedia's Five Pillars:

  * Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia
  * Wikipedia has a neutral point of view
  * Wikipedia is free content
  * Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner
  * Wikipedia does not have firm rules

  Let’s explore these a bit.
