  Your page is now living on Wikipedia, where it can be found by anyone with an
  internet connection and a curiosity about what you wrote!

  Other Wikipedians may stop by and give it a look, ask questions, or make
  suggestions. Some might even start making changes.

  Don't panic! This is the Wikipedia process. Everything you've contributed will
  always be accessible to your instructor, so don't worry about "protecting"
  your page from other editors.
