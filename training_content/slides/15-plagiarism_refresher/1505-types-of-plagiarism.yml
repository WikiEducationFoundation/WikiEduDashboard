summary:
content: |
  As you saw in the video, there are three basic types of plagiarism:

  * Unattributed plagiarism, where you copy text and don't credit the author.
  * Plagiarism of cited sources, where you copy text exactly (even when you credit the author).
  * Close paraphrasing, where you just *slightly* change the text of another author (cited or not).
