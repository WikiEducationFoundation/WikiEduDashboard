  Passage:
  > "In 1967, only 25% of eligible Boston voters supported a measure to limit
  the space afforded to keeping cattle in the city. Dr. Bickford's research
  suggests that this was on account of the confusing language on the ballot
  measure, and that support for the measure would have been higher had the
  memorandum been more clearly stated on the ballot."

        "In 1967, a quarter of votes approved a measure limiting the space for
        cattle in Boston. Some researchers suggest this was a result of a
        confusing memorandum, and that more voters would have supported limiting
        grazing space if the ballot was more clear."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Though the words here are different, the general structure is
        the same. It starts with the year, the number of voters and what they
        were voting on, and so forth. The words have changed, but the structure
        is not original.

        "Dr. Bickford wrote that 25% of eligible Boston voters supported a
        measure to limit the space afforded to cattle rearing in urban spaces."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Though the source of the information is clear (though
        technically wrong), it copies the information word for word. If this was
        a copyrighted text, it would be a copyright violation.

        "Research from 1967 suggests that support for cattle grazing in Boston
        was the result of confused voters and unclear balloting questions."
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! This is a good example of how to present information on
        Wikipedia, provided that you still cite the original text in the
        references section.

        "Most Boston voters couldn't understand the ballot question, so most
        voted in favor of limiting the space cattle could use to graze in the
        city."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! This is written in an original way, but be careful — the
        information in this sentence says the opposite of what the source says.
        That's why it's important to make sure you understand your material
        before attempting to write about it!
