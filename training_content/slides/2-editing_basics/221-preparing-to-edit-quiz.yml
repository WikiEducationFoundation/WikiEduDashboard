        Read the Talk page of the article to see if there are conflicts, and
        share your sources and plan for changes there.
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! It's polite to let other editors know what you're intending to
        do, and what source you'll use. Don't worry if nobody responds. Just
        sharing your intentions is a good idea.

        Copy and paste an entire article to your sandbox, make changes there,
        then copy and paste the article back to where you found it.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! This will delete the entire editing history of the article,
        and all of your changes will probably be reversed by another editor.
        Even if you plan to rewrite the entire article, it's best to make small
        changes to the article instead.

        Nothing. Just make the edit; if someone doesn't like it, they'll revise it.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! While this is true up to a point, it's helpful to reach out
        to other Wikipedians concerning any changes you want to make to an
        article.

        Find an experienced Wikipedian who is allowed to make the change for you.
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, including you.
        You can make the edit yourself. Of course, it's helpful to discuss
        planned changes with other editors first.
