  Wikipedia has a detailed [Manual of Style for medicine-related articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles).


  For student editors, two elements in particular can help avoid commons
  problems:


  * **PMID references:** for references to sources in PubMed, be sure to include
  the PMIDs within the citations. This ensures that other editors will be able
  to easily track down and verify the sources themselves.

  * **Recommended article sections:** for the common types of medicine-related
  articles — diseases and disorders, drugs and devices, surgeries and
  procedures, signs and symptoms, elements of anatomy, medical tests, etc. —
  there are [typical sections (in a typical order)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDSECTIONS)
  that are recommended. For new articles, or expansion of existing articles,
  students should take these standard organizational patterns as starting
  points.
