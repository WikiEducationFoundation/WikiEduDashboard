  When you assign students to edit medical topics, please plan to monitor
  student edits regularly and closely. Be prepared to participate in talk page
  discussions when students get in over their heads. This is good practice for
  any Wikipedia assignment, but it's especially important for medical topics,
  where experienced editors treat inadequate content with a sense of urgency due
  to the potential for harm.


  Ask students to post their sources to their selected articleâ€™s Talk page
  before they begin writing. That gives experienced editors a chance to review
  the sources ahead of time, which can help avoid frustration for the students
  and those who curate medical content. This contributes to positive dialogue
  and possibly even recommendations for additional sources!


  You are also strongly encouraged to discuss your plans with experienced
  medical editors. Post to the [Talk page of WikiProject Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine)
  to let folks know what you are planning.
