title: Identifying reliable medical sources
summary:
content: >
  Letâ€™s review sourcing. Proper use of sources is critical, and the standards
  for sourcing on medical topics differ from other topic areas. In particular,
  the use of primary sources is more strongly discouraged.


  Note that the rules for citations of biomedical content apply to *statements*
  on Wikipedia, not just articles.
