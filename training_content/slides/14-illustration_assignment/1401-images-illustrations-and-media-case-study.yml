title: Images, illustrations and media case study
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia isn't just text. Wikipedia articles also include images,
  illustrations, and video.

  Creating content that enhances a Wikipedia article can be an excellent
  small-scale project to make deeper connections to source material. It is also
  a great experiment for students engaged in media arts or production. They're
  asked to think about the information they read, and adapt it to a new medium.

  Some examples include:

  * Photographs of local landmarks, flora or fauna, etc.
  * Scanning and uploading historical documents or other materials in public domain.
  * Creating diagrams or illustrations of a scientific concept.

  Some instructors also use images as a complementary extra-credit assignment.

  Students enrolled in these courses receive a copy of the "Illustrating
  Wikipedia" brochure, which is a practical, step-by-step guide to sharing
  images on Commons.
