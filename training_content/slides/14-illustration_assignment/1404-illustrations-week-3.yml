title: "Week 3: Review of contributions"
summary:
content: |
  Grading for the assignment can be built into a review of the materials
  prepared and uploaded (not whether it stays on Wikipedia). Just as you would
  evaluate any media created for a given course, the same evaluation process can
  be used here.

  As you can see, this type of assignment can also serve as a short additional
  component for a course, or it can be attached to a longer Wikipedia
  assignment.
