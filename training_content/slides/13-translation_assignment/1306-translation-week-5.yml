title: "Week 5: Revise and review"
summary:
content: |
  In the final week of this sample course, students revise and review their
  work. They also discuss what they've learned about translation through the
  experience of transforming a Wikipedia article from one language to another.

  Grading the assignment varies by professor. In this case, for example,
  students are graded based on a portfolio they submit to the instructor. It
  includes the original French article and their translated versions, and some
  reflective feedback on their learning. Other instructors of advanced students
  may ask for a class presentation (in French) sharing their thoughts on the
  process and differences between the two articles.
