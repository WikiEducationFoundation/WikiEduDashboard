title: Be polite

content: |
  **Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner.**

  Anyone can edit, use, modify and distribute Wikipedia articles. Don't panic if
  someone else edits your work, or even removes your contributions.

  Every article has a Talk page where you can interact with the other editors
  who are working on your article. If you have a disagreement, keep some core
  Wikipedia values in mind:

  * Respect and be polite to your fellow Wikipedians, even when you disagree.
  * Avoid personal attacks. Talk to people you disagree with, and try to find
    consensus.
  * If you don’t agree with someone’s edit, don’t just “change it back.” That’s
    called an edit war, and it could get you both blocked! If you have a
    persistent disagreement, talk to your instructor or the Wikipedia Content
    Expert assigned to your course. They’ll help you get it fixed.
  * Act in good faith. Never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point.

  Being respectful isn’t limited to disagreements. Being polite means responding
  to messages left by other editors, thank people who help, and check back after
  your edits to see if anyone has responded. Always be mindful of the community
  around you.
