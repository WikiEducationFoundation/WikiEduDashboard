title: "Assignment: Add small amounts of content"
summary:
content: >
  This approach can still provide an overview of research methods while
  introducing students to Wikipedia. Students find, or are assigned, an article
  topic. They then conduct research for small bits of information that isnâ€™t
  included in the current version. They track their research, post the
  information, citing it to the source. The information can be anything from a
  sentence to a paragraph long.
