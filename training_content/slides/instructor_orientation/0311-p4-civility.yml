title: "Pillar 4: Editors should treat each other with respect and civility"
summary:
content: >
  Civility is a core tenet of Wikipedia. Unfortunately, online text is
  notoriously difficult to assess for tone or emotional nuance. Encourage
  students to “assume good faith” on the part of others. When a student’s work
  is questioned or removed, they should work with the editor to achieve a
  consensus about how to move forward.


  While unresolvable conflicts with students and editors are extremely rare,
  they can happen. If conflict arises, discuss details on the talk page, and
  contact the Content Expert assigned to your class to help. The earlier these
  conflicts are flagged, the more likely they are to reach a satisfying
  conclusion for both parties.
