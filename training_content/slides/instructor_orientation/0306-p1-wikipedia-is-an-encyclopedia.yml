  Wikipedia is the most recent development in encyclopedia production, and it
  follows many of the same practices as the traditional encyclopedia.


  The ideal Wikipedia article is well-sourced, with one or more verifiable
  citations for every claim. Volunteers scour articles to find poorly sourced or
  unsourced statements, or add updates with reliable sources where they are
  lacking. Learning how to write in an encyclopedic tone will be a critical part
  of your Wikipedia assignment.
