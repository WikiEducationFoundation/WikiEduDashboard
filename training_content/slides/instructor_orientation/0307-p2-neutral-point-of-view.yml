  Wikipedia strives for a “neutral point of view,” which is defined as
  “representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.”


  Students should:

  * contribute information without advocacy or opinion, not personal experience or interpretation

  * strive for a neutral tone that reflects the consensus of published literature and research

  * cite authoritative sources, which calls for critical evaluations of text.
