title: "Pillar 2: Wikipedia has a neutral point of view"
summary:
content: >
  Wikipedia strives for a “neutral point of view,” which is defined as
  “representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.”


  This means students should contribute information without advocacy or opinion.
  Students should strive for a neutral tone that reflects the consensus of
  published literature and research. That means citing authoritative sources,
  which calls for critical evaluations of texts. Articles should not feature
  student editors' personal experiences, interpretations, or opinions.


  However, as students revise their articles or create new ones, they may also
  come to understand how the organization of those facts reveals decisions about
  the weight of one perspective over another. Wikipedia’s neutral point of view
  is a great place to cultivate critical reading and evaluation skills. Students
  will have to think about balancing competing claims within the texts they
  read, and judge which source should be considered more reliable. In many
  cases, they will integrate both sets of claims neutrally.
