  Writing for Wikipedia is an exercise in critical thinking. There’s no fixed
  template for how to write an article, and every article is different.


  Likewise, rules in Wikipedia are not carved in stone, as their wording and
  interpretation are likely to change over time. The principles and spirit of
  Wikipedia's rules matter more than their literal wording, and sometimes
  improving Wikipedia requires making an exception to a rule.


  We encourage new editors to “Be bold, but not reckless” as they update
  articles. Students can’t “break” Wikipedia, because every page is saved and
  can be reverted.
