  Wiki Ed offers a variety of materials to students and instructors, free of charge.
  We can also provide printed copies, free, for courses that are registered on our
  dashboard.


  All of these are available to peruse through our
  [Teaching Resources](http://wikiedu.org/for-instructors/) page (which we
  suggest you open and bookmark right now!).
