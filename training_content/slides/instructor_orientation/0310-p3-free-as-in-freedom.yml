  Everything on Wikipedia is free to use. That doesn't mean that anything put
  onto Wikipedia can be used freely. Copying and pasting material from
  copyrighted authors into Wikipedia is against the rules.


  Volunteers pay close attention to new content to identify copyright violations
  and/or plagiarism.


  Encourage your students to:

  * understand the material they read

  * rephrase it from a neutral perspective

  * add the content, citing the original source


  Likewise, anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute Wikipedia articles. We
  encourage instructors to make this possibility clear with students at the
  outset. Assure students that they will not be penalized for edits to their
  articles, even wholesale deletions. Their contributions can still be tracked
  and assessed.
