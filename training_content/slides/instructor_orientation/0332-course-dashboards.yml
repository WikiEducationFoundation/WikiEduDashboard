  Your course dashboard is designed to facilitate your Wikipedia assignment from
  beginning to end. You'll begin by creating a timeline for your course with our
  assignment design tool. The timeline will not replace the syllabus for your
  course, but will provide your students with a series of weekly milestones to
  prepare them for each stage of the editing process, along with relevant
  trainings and resources. You will use the dashboard to track the work that
  your students do on Wikipedia,from assigning articles to peer reviews.


  Your course page will have the following sections:


  **Activity:** At the top of every page is a motivational bar showing the total
  results of your course’s impact on Wikipedia: How many assignments you’ve
  worked on or created, how much content your course has contributed, and, best
  of all, how many readers have checked out those articles! You can share this
  at the end of the assignment to drive home the impact that students have made.


  **Overview:** This section has an introductory text about your course and the
  current milestone (with some guidance and links to relevant help materials)
  for the week. You'll also find your Wikipedia Content Expert listed.


  **Timeline:** The Timeline tab has a complete list of relevant Wikipedia-based
  milestones for your assignment. You can also edit these segments to
  incorporate your own course activities or reading if you'd like to make this a
  one-stop resource for students. However, many instructors direct their
  students to the Timeline independently of the course syllabus. It's up to you.


  **Students:** The students tab shows your students’ usernames; the articles
  they’ve been assigned to write; the articles of other students they’re
  peer-reviewing; and how many edits each student has made in the previous 7
  days. Finally, the chart shows you how many characters students have added to
  Mainspace (usually that means articles) and to Userspace (usually, that means
  their sandboxes or Talk pages). There’s a little arrow to drop down and see
  more details, including links to every page a student has edited while logged
  in under their usernames.


  **Articles:** You can also sort student work by articles, which is helpful for
  tracking group editing assignments.


  **Uploads:** This tab offer a stream of images your students have uploaded (if
  any).


  **Activity:** This stream shows you an up-to-date history of all the Wikipedia
  activity coming from your students
