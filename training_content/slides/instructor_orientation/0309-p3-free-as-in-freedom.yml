title: "Pillar 3: Wikipedia is free content"
summary:
content: >
  Everything on Wikipedia is free to use. That doesn't mean that anything put
  onto Wikipedia can be used freely. Copying and pasting material from
  copyrighted authors into Wikipedia is against the rules.


  Because Wikipedia is free to use, volunteers pay close attention to new
  uploads and additions, monitoring them for copyright violations and/or
  plagiarism. It's crucial to encourage your students to understand the material
  they read, process it, rephrase it from a neutral perspective, and then add
  the content, while still citing the original source.


  Likewise, anyone can edit, use, modify and distribute Wikipedia articles.
  We encourage instructors to make this possibility clear with students at the
  outset. Assure students that edits to their articles, even wholesale
  deletions, by outside editors will not be penalized. Their contributions can
  still be tracked and assessed.
