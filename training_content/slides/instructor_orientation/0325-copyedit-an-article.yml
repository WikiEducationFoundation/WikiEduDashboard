title: Assignment: Copyedit an article
summary:
content: >
  For writing courses with many students, copyediting Wikipedia articles is a
  good way to “get their feet wet” with Wikipedia. Students should be asked to
  engage other editors to identify areas for improvement in a Wikipedia article.
  Copyediting can include basic typos and grammar, but would also apply to
  instances where word choices don't reflect a neutral position. This analysis
  and collaboration exposes copyediting as a politically fraught process!


  A similar assignment includes copyediting specifically with an eye toward
  plagiarism. Students identify close paraphrasing or plagiarism by comparing
  information in an article to its cited source. Then, they flag it on the
  article Talk page.
