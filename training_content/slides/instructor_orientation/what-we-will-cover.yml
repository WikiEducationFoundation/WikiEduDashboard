content: >
  First, we’ll look at some of the core policies and guidelines of Wikipedia.
  You might want to complement this broad overview by taking the student
  training later on. That way, you’ll learn greater details about editing, and
  have a chance to see the Wikipedia training for your students.

  Then, we’ll go over the basics of designing a Wikipedia assignment by sharing
  what we’ve learned from hundreds of instructors since 2010. We’ll also walk
  through a class that incorporates a common Wikipedia writing assignment.

  Finally, we’ll give you an overview of the tools offered by the Wiki Education
  Foundation, including print resources, staff experts, and a dashboard for
  tracking your students’ contributions to Wikipedia.
