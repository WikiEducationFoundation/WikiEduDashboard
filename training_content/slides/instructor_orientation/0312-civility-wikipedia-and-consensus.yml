title: "Civility: Wikipedia and consensus"
summary:
content: >
  Consensus is the main way decisions are made on Wikipedia, in terms of article
  content, and how Wikipedia is run. It's not a matter of voting, and nobody is
  "in charge" over a final say.


  Instead, the consensus view of a Wikipedia article represents the facts that
  *even opposing sides agree are relevant*. Wikipedia's concept of consensus
  doesn't mean that everyone always agrees, but it involves an effort to
  incorporate all editors' legitimate concerns, while respecting Wikipedia's
  policies and guidelines.


  When disagreements occur, they can best be resolved through discussion —
  usually on the relevant Talk page. Since Wikipedia articles should be written
  from a neutral point of view — fairly describing significant viewpoints on a
  subject without endorsing any of them — it is usually possible to reach a
  point where both sides believe their position is described accurately.
