  Here are a few types of assignments that you can start from. Of course, you
  can adjust and adapt the course assignment from how itâ€™s described here.


  Some of these assignments have an additional, optional, training module
  associated with them. It can be helpful to take these trainings, which are
  generally short, before teaching your assignment, even if you're adding a
  small component of it to your course.
