title: "Critique an article"
summary:
content: >
  Wikipedia can be a great source for developing critical reading and evaluation
  skills.


  **Evaluate an article:** Assign students to read an article and assess it
  based on your course learning. Students may be encouraged to contribute
  (polite) critiques to the Talk page of an article, or to write an essay
  analyzing their findings.


  **Knowledge construction:** Combined with writing an article, this evaluation
  assignment can present unique opportunities to examine questions of
  "consensus" and "neutrality" on Wikipedia. In this variation of the writing
  assignment, students focus on content missing from Wikipedia and examine the
  absence as a critique of systemic bias. In the meantime, students contribute
  content that had previously been missing.
