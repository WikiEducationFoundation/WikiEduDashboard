content: >
  First, we’ll look at some of Wikipedia's core policies and guidelines. You
  might want to complement this overview by taking the student training later
  on. That way, you’ll learn greater details about editing, and see the
  Wikipedia training for your students.


  Then, we’ll go over the basics of designing a Wikipedia assignment by sharing
  what we’ve learned from hundreds of instructors since 2010. We’ll also walk
  through a class that incorporates a common Wikipedia writing assignment.


  Finally, we’ll give you an overview of the tools offered by the Wiki Education
  Foundation.
