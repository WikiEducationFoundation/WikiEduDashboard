title: Meet Wikipedia’s community
summary:
content: >
  The English Wikipedia has about 30,000 active editors (as of 2013), or
  "Wikipedians." It ranges from niche editors who build articles in a particular
  subject area, to "WikiGnomes" who work quietly formatting pages, to vandal
  fighters who fix bad edits, to reviewers who help run Wikipedia's peer-review
  processes, to administrators who clean up messes and block disruptive editors,
  to policy wonks who analyze how Wikipedia works and discuss ways to improve
  it — and more.


  What we have in common is a passion for Wikipedia. Although we come from
  different perspectives (and often disagree!), we're here to make Wikipedia
  better.
