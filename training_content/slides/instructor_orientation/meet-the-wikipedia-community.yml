title: Meet Wikipedia’s community
summary:
content: >
  The English Wikipedia has about 30,000 active editors (as of 2013), or
  "Wikipedians." It ranges from niche editors who build articles in a particular
  subject area, to "WikiGnomes" who work quietly formatting pages and tying up
  loose ends, to vandal fighters who monitor recent changes and revert bad
  edits, to reviewers who help run Wikipedia's peer review processes, to
  administrators who clean up messes and block disruptive editors, to policy
  wonks who analyze how Wikipedia works and discuss ways to improve it—and many
  more roles. What we have in common is that we care—very deeply—about
  Wikipedia. Although we come from different perspectives (and often disagree!)
  we're all here to try to make Wikipedia better.
