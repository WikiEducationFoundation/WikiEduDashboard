  Wikipedia is a tertiary source of information, based on a collection of
  secondary sources writing about a primary source. Wikipedia is not a place to
  publish original research or to synthesize ideas. It’s a place to summarize
  what has been written in reliable sources about the topic.


  On the internet, nobody knows if you're a dog — or an accomplished scholar.
  Content on Wikipedia *must* stand on its own, without an appeal to authority.
  That means a critical reader should expect to find any claims in an article
  supported by the sources it cites.


  Some instructors find success in assigning students to write an
  encyclopedia-style article for Wikipedia, and then to use that research as the
  basis for a second, offline, traditional research paper.
