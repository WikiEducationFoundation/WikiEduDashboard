title: Translate an article
summary:

  Often, there's great content in non-English editions of Wikipedia that isnâ€™t
  well-covered on the English Wikipedia, and visa-versa. In this assignment,
  students translate high-quality articles from the language they are studying
  to share on their native-language Wikipedia. Some instructors in advanced
  (graduate) classes ask students to fact-check target language sources on the
  target-language Wikipedia article.

  Ideal for:

  * Foreign language courses

  * Students with native fluency in the language they are writing for


  Learning objectives:

  * Writing skills

  * Media and information literacy

  * Collaboration

  * Communication skills
