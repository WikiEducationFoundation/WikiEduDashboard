title: Notability

content: >
  As students create new articles on topics relevant to your field, it may not
  be immediately clear that the topic warrants its own Wikipedia article. In
  some cases, you may need to explain why the article topic should remain in
  Wikipedia. Significant coverage in reliable sources, independent of the
  subject, is the key to notability.


  The volunteers who monitor new articles on Wikipedia are sorting through a
  barrage of spam, joke pages, and self-promotion. Editors will quickly review a
  page for sources that establish notability. Thatâ€™s why many assignments
  encourage students to collect resources first, and to share that bibliography
  with other editors right away, even going so far as to state "this topical is
  notable because..." on the Talk page.

  Expert assigned to your course.
