title: Orientation for health-related content

  That's it for the instructor orientation!


  If you are teaching about medical or psychology content (anything related to
  human health), you are strongly encouraged to take the orientation module for
  medical and health-related content. It's much shorter than this module, and
  should take about 20 minutes to complete. Would you like to start that now?

    Yes, I teach on health-related matters and would like to take the training.
