title: Neutral point of view and critical thinking
summary:
content: >
  Wikipediaâ€™s neutral point of view policy is a great way to cultivate critical
  reading and evaluation skills. As students revise or create articles,
  discussions can reveal how the organization of facts reflects individual
  decisions about the weight of one perspective over another.


  Students will have to:

  * balance competing claims within the texts they read,

  * judge which source should be considered more reliable

  * integrate both sets of claims neutrally


  Instructors often find it helpful to encourage students to analyze the choices
  they make about weight, reliability and their own ideas of neutrality.
