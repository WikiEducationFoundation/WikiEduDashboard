title: "Pillar 4: Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner"
summary:
content: >
  Civility is a core tenet of Wikipedia. Unfortunately, online text is
  notoriously difficult to assess for tone or emotional nuance. Encourage
  students to “assume good faith” on the part of others. When a student’s work
  is questioned or removed, they should work with the editor to achieve a
  consensus about how to move forward.

  While unresolvable conflicts with students and editors are extremely rare,
  they can happen. If conflict arises, discuss details on the talk page, and
  contact the Content Expert assigned to your class to help. The earlier these
  conflicts are flagged, the more likely they are to reach a satisfying
  conclusion for both parties.

  Consensus is the main way decisions are made on Wikipedia, both in terms of
  article content and how Wikipedia itself is run. It's not a matter of voting,
  and nobody is in charge over a final say.

  Instead, the consensus view on Wikipedia represents the facts that even
  opposing sides agree are relevant. Wikipedia's concept of consensus doesn't
  always mean that everyone agrees, but it involves an effort to incorporate all
  editors' legitimate concerns, while respecting Wikipedia's policies and
  guidelines.

  When disagreements occur, we resolve them through discussion—usually on the
  relevant Talk page. Since Wikipedia articles should be written from a neutral
  point of view—fairly describing significant viewpoints on a subject without
  endorsing any of them—it is almost always possible to reach consensus about
  article content, even if editors have fundamentally different points of view.
