title: What’s Wikipedia?
summary:
content: >
  Wikipedia is “the encyclopedia that anyone can edit.” However, editing does
  not take place in a vacuum. Wikipedia is the work of a community that follows
  five guiding principles, or *pillars*.


  Without that community, there’s no Wikipedia. Your course is not just
  interacting with this community, it's a part of it. That’s why it’s important
  to understand Wikipedia's culture.
