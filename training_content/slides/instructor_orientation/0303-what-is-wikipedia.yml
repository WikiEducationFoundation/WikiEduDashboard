title: What’s Wikipedia?
summary:
content: >
  Wikipedia is “the encyclopedia that anyone can edit.” However, editing does
  not take place in a vacuum. Wikipedia is the work of a community that follows
  five guiding principles, or pillars. There's also a governance structure that
  shapes the content development process.


  Without that community, there’s no Wikipedia. And when you or your students
  edit Wikipedia, you’ll not only be interacting with this community - you’ll
  become part of it. That’s why it’s important for you and your students to
  understand the culture of Wikipedia, especially as they serve as guides for
  the unique way knowledge is constructed on Wikipedia.
