  Below motivational bar are several tabs.


  **Overview:** This section has an introductory text about your course and the
  current milestone (with some guidance and links to relevant help materials)
  for the week. You'll also find your Wikipedia Content Expert listed.


  **Timeline:** The Timeline tab has a complete list of relevant Wikipedia-based
  milestones for your assignment. You can also edit these segments to
  incorporate your own course activities or reading if you'd like to make this a
  one-stop resource for students. However, many instructors direct their
  students to the Timeline independently of the course syllabus. It's up to you.


  **Students:** The students tab shows your students’ usernames; the articles
  they’ve been assigned to write; the articles of other students they’re
  peer-reviewing; and how many edits each student has made in the previous 7
  days. Finally, the chart shows you how many characters students have added to
  Mainspace (their articles) and to Userspace (usually, that means
  their sandboxes or user pages). There’s a little arrow to drop down and see
  more details, including links to every page a student has edited while logged
  in under their usernames.


  **Articles:** You can also sort student work by articles, which is helpful for
  tracking group editing assignments.


  **Uploads:** This tab offers a stream of images your students have uploaded
  (if any).


  **Activity:** This stream shows you an up-to-date history of all the Wikipedia
  activity coming from your students.
