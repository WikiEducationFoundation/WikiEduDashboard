title: Training for students
summary:
content: |
  Right now, you’re taking an orientation module for educators.

  Wiki Ed also offers several [training modules for students](/training/students),
  covering topics such as Wikipedia culture, and how to edit. We recommend new
  instructors take this student training, too — it’s a good way to see exactly
  what your students will learn, but also a great way to gather some basic
  editing skills for yourself ahead of time. You’ll find the training linked
  from your course page.

  If you are teaching medical or health topics, we highly recommend taking an
  additional training module on that subject. It’s shorter than this one, but
  includes important information about Wikipedia’s stringent policies on medical
  and health editing.

  You’ll also have the option of assigning, or taking, additional mini-modules
  throughout your course.
