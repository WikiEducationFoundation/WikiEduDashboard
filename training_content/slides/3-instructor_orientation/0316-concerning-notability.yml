title: Notability

content: >
  As students create new articles on topics relevant to your field, it may not
  be immediately clear to other Wikipedians that the topic warrants a Wikipedia article. 
  
  The Wikipedians who monitor new articles are sorting through a barrage of spam, joke pages, 
  and self-promotion. They will quickly review a page for sources that establish *notability*. 
  
  
  The best way to show that a topic is notable is to show that there is significant coverage 
  in reliable sources, independent of the subject.
  
  
  If Wikipedians can't find these sources, they're likely to remove the article and quickly 
  move on to the next in the queue. That’s why many assignments encourage students to collect 
  resources first, and to share that bibliography on the article's Talk page, even going so 
  far as to state *"this topic is notable because..."*
