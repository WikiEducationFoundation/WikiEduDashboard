title: Be bold!

content: >
  The *Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle* is one good way to think about the
  consensus editing process. Here’s how we frame it for students:


  **Be Bold:** If you think you can make an article better, but you aren't sure
  whether others will disagree with the changes you want to make, you should
  start by boldly editing as you think best.


  **Revert:** If your edit gets reverted by another editor, that's OK! You've
  simply met an editor with a different view about the article. This is your
  chance to see Wikipedia's consensus model in action. You can check the Edit History 
  page, which shows recent changes and the reasons why. There may be a note on the 
  Talk page, too. In any event, do not simply make your edit again; that's not 
  building consensus, that's the beginning of an “edit war.” It's actually seen 
  as very aggressive, and could get you temporarily blocked!)


  **Discuss:** Start a discussion on the Talk page (if the other editor has not
  done so already) — politely! After all, you both want to improve Wikipedia.
  Explain why you made the edit. Work with the other editor(s) to develop a
  consensus. Be confident, but listen and consider all objections. When you've
  found some common ground, you can make more edits.
