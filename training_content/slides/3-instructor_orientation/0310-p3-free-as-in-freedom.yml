  Everything on Wikipedia is free to use. That means copying and pasting material from
  copyrighted authors into Wikipedia is against the rules. Instead, you'll encourage
  students to carefully paraphrase what they learn.


  Wikipedians pay close attention to new content to identify copyright violations
  and/or plagiarism. If plagiarism is caught, it could mean the student is banned from editing.


  Encourage your students to:

  * Understand the material they read

  * Rephrase it from a neutral perspective

  * Add the content, citing the original source


  Likewise, anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute Wikipedia articles. We
  encourage instructors to make it clear to students that their work might be deleted
  or edited - and that it's OK! 
  
  
  Assure students that their grade will not be penalized for anyone else's edits to their articles, 
  even wholesale deletions. Student contributions can still be tracked and assessed.
