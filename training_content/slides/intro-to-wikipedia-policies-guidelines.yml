  Although Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, that doesn't mean that everyone can edit it independently. Article development is *not* the result of chaotic, random edits.

  Wikipedia is the result of a community that follows five guiding principles (_pillars_), and makes sure these principles are followed by others. There's also a governance structure that shapes the content development process.

  Without this community, there's no Wikipedia. And when you edit Wikipedia, you're a part of this community. So it's best to learn what's expected!
