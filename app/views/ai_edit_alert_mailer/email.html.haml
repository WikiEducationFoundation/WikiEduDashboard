              %h2.info † About AI detection
              %p.info
                AI detectors are not foolproof, but Pangram is reliable enough to catch many cases of AI-generated text
                (which should not be added to Wikipedia).
              %p.info
                We've noted that Pangram sometimes reports false positives by flagging lists of references. Using
                an AI copyediting tool (like Grammarly) can also result in text that Pangram detects as
                AI-generated, but such AI copyediting can also introduce factual errors and distortions of meaning,
                so you should not use such tools when writing for Wikipedia.
              %p.info
                Pangram analyzes text in segments of approximately 400 words at a time, assigning an "AI likelihood"
                to each segment. The resulting report includes an overall "AI likelihood", as well as individual
                likelihoods for each segment. Based on Wiki Education's experience so far, AI-generated text that has
                been significantly edited is often detected as "possibly AI" with an intermediate likelihood, while
                most text copied directly from common AI tools as of September 2025 is flagged as nearly 100% AI likelihood,
                and most Wikipedia text with no AI involvement is flagged close to 0% AI likelihood.
              %p.info
                Pangram also predicts which Large Language Model (LLM) was used, although with significant uncertainty. Note
                that many AI tools use one of the leading commercial LLMs under the hood.
