              %p.info
                AI detectors are not foolproof, but Pangram is reliable enough to catch many cases of AI-generated text
                (which should not be added to Wikipedia).
              %p.info
                We've found that Pangram is highly reliable when it comes to Wikipedia article prose. It is less reliable —
                resulting in false positives — when there are significant non-prose elements, such as bibliograhic citations,
                bullet lists, fragmentary outlines, and other formatting-heavy content. Before analyzing an edit,
                the Dashboard attempts to isolate the prose portions and convert it to plaintext. The Pangram report shows
                this isolated plaintext, which in most cases excludes citations, Wikipedia templates, and other common non-prose
                elements. Let us know if significant non-prose elements remain that you suspect resulted in a false positive.
              %p.info
                In broad strokes, Pangram is designed to detect the statistical fingerprint of text generated by a
                Large Language Model (LLM). It can't easily differentiate between text that was generated directly from a
                chatbot prompt versus human text that was rewritten by an LLM-driven copyediting tool or chatbot. Extensive use of
                an AI copyediting tool — including Grammarly — can result in text that Pangram detects as AI-generated, but such
                AI copyediting can also introduce factual errors and distortions of meaning, so students should not use such tools
                when writing for Wikipedia. Mixed writing — where LLM-generated text and human-written text are combined —
                typically results in an intermediate AI likelihood in Pangram's results, roughly corresponding to the portion of
                the text that came from an LLM. Simple spelling or grammar fixes typically do not trigger Pangram (although
                LLM-driven grammar fixes still often change the intended meaning in subtle ways).
              %p.info
                Pangram analyzes text in segments of approximately 400 words at a time, assigning an "AI likelihood"
                to each segment. (It is less reliable on very short segments.) The resulting report includes an overall
                "AI likelihood", as well as individual likelihoods for each segment. Based on Wiki Education's experience so far,
                AI-generated text that has been significantly edited is often detected as "possibly AI" with an intermediate
                likelihood, while most text copied directly from common AI tools as of late 2025 is flagged as nearly 100% AI
                likelihood, and most Wikipedia text with no AI involvement is flagged close to 0% AI likelihood.
