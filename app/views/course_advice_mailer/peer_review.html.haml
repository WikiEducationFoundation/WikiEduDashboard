                We recommend that all students review at least one of their peer's contributions, and
                the Dashboard has the infrastructure to support peer review.
              %p.paragraph
                When students are ready for the peer review portion of the project, they should launch the
                %a.link{href: 'https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/peer-review'} 'Peer review'
                training module. This will provide them with tips on how to craft their reviews, how to select an article
                to review using the Dashboard, and where to complete them.
              %p.paragraph
                You have two options for assigning peer reviews: you can assign them yourself, or you can let the
                students choose which classmates' articles they want to review.
                If you are assigning the peer reviews, you can assign each student individually (by clicking their username
                from the Students tab, then clicking 'Assign/remove a peer review'),
                or you can randomly assign reviews to all your students at once. To use the random assignment feature, go to the
                %a.link{href: "#{@course_link}/students"} Students tab
                of your course page click on the "Assign random peer reviews" button.
              %p.paragraph
                Once a review is assigned, the My Articles section of the Dashboard will provide a link to the
                sandbox page where the student can compose their review. As long as they are signed in on Wikipedia,
                the link will also prepopulate the review page with a template of guiding questions and considerations,
                %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org_peer_review'}like this.
              %p.paragraph
                You can find these reviews, once completed, by going to the Students tab and navigating to the
                'Assignments & Exercises' section. See also our
                %a.link{href: 'https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/faq/15/'}FAQ about the peer review process.
              %p.paragraph
                Sometimes students post their peer reviews in a place other than where the Dashboard recommends.
                You can see a list of any student's sandbox pages by navigating to the Students tab of
                your course page and clicking on the 'sandboxes' link for their account.
