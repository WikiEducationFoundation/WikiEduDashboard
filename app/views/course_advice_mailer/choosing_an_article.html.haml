                It's time for your students to start choosing the articles they'll be working

                In many ways, the success of your students' contributions begins with article choice.
                Please read through this message carefully, and be sure to check out the articles
                your students are planning on improving to ensure their viability.
              %h2.headline How should students go about finding articles to work on?
              %p.paragraph
                Students should begin by taking the training module on
                = succeed ',' do
                  %a.link{href: 'https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/finding-your-article'} finding articles
                followed by going through the
                = succeed '.' do
                  %a.link{href: 'https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/choose-topic-exercise'} exercise on choosing an article
                Both activities will guide them on how to search Wikipedia for appropriate articles to work
                on for their Wikipedia assignment, and how to indicate their final article choice on the
                Dashboard. Students can also make use of the Dashboard's article finder which they'll
                access on the My Articles portion of your course page's Home tab. Students should consider
                a few different options before settling on their final article and list these potential
                choices on the designated page the "Choose your article" exercise will direct them to.
              %p.paragraph
                You can find the list of articles your students are proposing to work on by navigating
                to the Students tab of your course page, and then clicking on the activities and exercises
                link. Look for the article choice link for each student to see the articles they're proposing.
              %h2.headline What types of articles should students work on?     
              %p.paragraph
                The best articles for students to work on are those that are highly relevant to a particular
                field, with a good amount of available sources, but that are relatively underdeveloped on Wikipedia.
                Your role as a subject-matter expert is especially important for providing guidance at this stage.
              %p.paragraph
                Article choice and sourcing go hand in hand. If a topic is sparsely covered in the literature,
                students will struggle to make a meaningful contribution even if the article is in need of work.
                As a student starts narrowing down the articles they'd like to tackle, they should begin to
                develop their bibliography to ensure that the topic they wish to cover has sufficient sourcing.
              %h2.headline What types of articles should students avoid?
              %p.paragraph
                Your students will generally find it more difficult to make meaningful contributions to the
                following types of articles. In most cases you should steer them away from these categories:
                %ul.paragraph
                  %li
                    Articles that cover broad topics: Students may be tempted to make contributions to broad,
                    sweeping topics, such as
                    %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law'} law
                    or
                    = succeed '.' do
                      %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion'} religion
                    Instead, students should peruse these broad articles for related topics that are more narrow
                    and in need of improvement.
                  %li
                    Articles that have a rating above B: Articles that have a
                    %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment#Grades'} high rating on Wikipedia's assessment system
                    (A-class, Good article, and Featured article) have gone through a vetting and review process
                    by the community. They are typically already very well-developed and closely monitored.
                    Students should avoid any article with these ratings. Examples of these articles include
                    %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River'} Hudson River
                    and 
                    = succeed '.' do
                      %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat'} Angkor Wat
                  %li
                    Contentious subjects: Many students will want to contribute to articles about which they are passionate.
                    These may include current political and social issues that are themselves being hotly debated on Wikipedia.
                    Students should follow their interests, but they can make more meaningful contributions to specific sub-topics
                    rather than the main article for a hotbed topic. Students should avoid getting involved in existing Wikipedia
                    controversies.
                  %li
                    Topics with few or low-quality sources: When choosing an article, students need to ensure that the subject they
                    wish to address has enough available, published sourcing to support their writing. Sometimes an article is underdeveloped
                    simply because there isn't enough literature to expand it further. This is why sourcing and article choice are
                    so closely linked.
              %h2.headline What if my student(s) choose to work on a new article?
              %p.paragraph
                The vast majority of students we support work on existing articles, but if your students choose to create a new entry,
                they should consider the following critical points:
                %ul.paragraph
                  %li
                    Does the topic meet Wikipedia's
                    %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability'} notability
                    requirements? To meet notability requirements, students must find
                    2-3 sources with substantial coverage that are independent of the subject, reliable, and verifiable. This can
                    be especially difficult when writing about living persons, or persons and subjects from historically underrepresented
                    communities.
                  %li
                    Does an article on the topic already exist on Wikipedia? Before students start working on a new article, they must
                    be certain that the article does not already exist on Wikipedia potentially under a different name, or as part of
                    another article. (In some cases, it will make sense to create a new article for a topic that is covered briefly as
                    a subtopic within an existing article, but students should plan for how content should be spread between the
                    existing article and a potential new article to avoid unnecessary redundant content.)
              %h2.headline How can I, as their instructor, help?
              %p.paragraph
                Before your students begin to expand their bibliographies and draft their contributions, ensure
                that the articles they have chosen to work on follow the guidelines outlined above. Again, as a
                subject-matter expert, you can identify which topics are important and relevant in your field but are
                not well-developed on Wikipedia. Please guide your students toward these topics and toward good
                sourcing in your area of expertise. This is your chance to make sure that your students have a
                real impact and that their work remains on Wikipedia in the long run.
