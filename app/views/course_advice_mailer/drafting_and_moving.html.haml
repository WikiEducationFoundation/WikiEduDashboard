                Once your students have selected an article to work on and have gathered sources to
                improve their chosen topic, it will be time to begin drafting their main contribution!

                Once students have assigned themselves their main article(s), the Dashboard will provide links to the
                specific sandbox page where each article's draft should be prepared. Students can find these links in
                My Articles section of the Home tab, and you can find them under 'Assigned Articles' in the
                %a.link{href: "#{@course_link}/students/articles"} Students Assignments view
                when you select an individual student.
              %p.paragraph
                Sometimes students end up doing work in a place other than where the Dashboard recommends. You can see a
                list of any student's sandbox pages by navigating to the Students tab of your course page and clicking
                on the 'sandboxes' link for their account.

                A few things to remember:
                %ul.paragraph
                  %li
                    Sandboxes are considered draft spaces on Wikipedia, but they are still publicly accessible like all
                    Wikipedia pages. Students must adhere to Wikipedia policies in their sandboxes.
                  %li
                    If students are working on existing articles, they should not copy over the whole article into their
                    sandbox. Rather, they should only copy over the section(s) they're working on.
                  - unless @course.stay_in_sandbox?
                    %li
                      While the sandbox is a great place to experiment and get your draft ready, students shouldn't spend
                      too long there. A few weeks should be enough for them to get their contribution up and ready for
                      Wikipedia's live article space.

                %h2.headline Moving work out of the sandbox
                %p.paragraph
                  When students are ready to move their work into the article main space, they should take the

                  A few critical points:
                  %ul.paragraph
                    %li
                      After students move their work, they should be sure to pay attention to any feedback from community members.
                      They are now members of the Wikipedia community and have a responsibility toward that community.
                    %li
                      If student work is removed, students should reach out to the editor who removed the work to try
                      to understand why, and how they can improve it. They should NEVER just put the work back
                      into the article without discussion. This type of activity — an "edit war" — may lead them to getting blocked.
                    %li
                      Stress to your students that their grade is not dependent on whether the work remains on Wikipedia
                      and that you will always be able to see their contributions in their edit history.
