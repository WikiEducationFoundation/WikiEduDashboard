                  Here's a guide on
                  %a.link{href: 'https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/faq/1/'} how to use the dashboard to see your student contributions.
                %li
                  Remember, never base grades on whether student work remains on Wikipedia; instead, assess the quality of their contribution.
                  If their work has been removed, it will still be available via the Wikipedia page's 'View history' tab in most cases.
                  If you run into trouble, reach out to your Wikipedia Expert.
                %li
                  Ideally you'll be able to use the Dashboard's
                  %a.link{href: "#{@course_link}/students/articles"} Students Assignments view
                  to find each student's contributions, but in case their work isn't where the Dashboard expects it to be, the most useful
                  tools for tracking down a student's contributions are a student's 'sandboxes' link — which goes to a page listing every
                  sandbox page associated with their username — and the 'edits' link, which goes to the full list of every edit they've made on
                  Wikipedia.
              %h2.headline Dealing with problematic contributions
              %p.paragraph
                If a student has done a poor job with their contributions to a live article, make sure they aren't making
                Wikipedia worse. Ideally, you can guide students to correct major problems with their work before the assignment ends.
                If it's too late for that, there are a few options:
              %ul.paragraph
                %li
                  Fix the article yourself. If there's a good way to salvage the good parts of a problematic article by correcting mistakes,
                  improving the language, or removing some of the content, go for it!
                  %a.link{href: 'https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/instructors/fixing-bad-articles/instructors-role-in-cleanup'} This training module
                  offers a quick overview of how to fix an article that's in a bad state.
                %li
                  Undo the student work. Especially if no one else has been changing an article lately, rolling it back to its state just before
                  the first student edit can be an efficient solution.

                  Notify Wiki Education so that we can clean it up. When using the Article Viewer to review one of the edited articles, you can click
                  the 'Quality Problems?' button at the upper right, explain what's wrong, and Wiki Education staff will take care of it.

              %p.paragraph
                If a student has used ChatGPT or a similar generative text tool to produce Wikipedia content, it's likely to have significant problems —
                especially when it comes to factual accuracy and use of references (which ChatGPT often simply fabricates). As of early 2023, Wikipedia does
                not explicitly disallow text from ChatGPT, but it should be handled like other problematic content (unless it's been carefully checked against
                real sources with citations added). For more, see
                %a.link{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models'} "Wikipedia:Large language models".
