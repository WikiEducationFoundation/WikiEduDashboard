                  Wikipedia. Still no luck? Reach out to us for help.

              %p.paragraph
                The goal of this project is to make Wikipedia content better. Ideally, you can guide students to correct major
                problems with their work before the assignment ends. If it's too late for that, there are a few options:
              %ul.paragraph
                %li
                  %strong Fix the article yourself.
                  If there's a good way to salvage the good parts of a problematic article by correcting mistakes,
                  improving the language, or removing some of the content, go for it!

                %li
                  %strong Undo the student work.
                  Especially if no one else has made recent changes to the article, rolling it back to its
                  state just before the first student edit can be an efficient solution.

                  When using the Article Viewer to review one of the edited articles,
                  you can click the 'Quality Problems?' button at the upper right,
                  explain what's wrong, and Wiki Education staff will take care of it.
              %h2.headline Dealing with AI-generated text
              %p.paragraph
                Our training modules explain why students should NOT use AI tools
                to generate new text for Wikipedia — the resulting content is likely
                to have significant problems, including use of fake sources, mismatched
                citations, language that too closely paraphrases the source, non-neutral
                writing, and much more. These kinds of harmful contributions should be
                handled like any other problematic content as outlined above.
