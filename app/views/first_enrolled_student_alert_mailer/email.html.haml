                It looks like your class is getting started with the Wikipedia signup process.
                You can view a list of the enrolled students, and see which articles they are assigned
                to write or review, in the <strong>Students tab</strong> of your dashboard.wikiedu.org
                course page.

                Use the dropdown for each student to see their progress through the training modules
                and view their recent edits.

                The interface for your students is largely the same as it is for you. The key
                differences are that students may not edit the course details or the Timeline,
                students may only add assignments and reviews for themselves, and the Home tab
                includes the additional <strong>My Articles section</strong> highlighting their
                own assigned articles. It also highlights the due date of the first
                of the #{link_to 'assigned training modules', @timeline_link}
                that the student hasn't yet completed.
