                I'd like to share some resources as you begin your Wikipedia assignment:
              %ol
                %li.numbered-item
                  %p.paragraph
                    While Wikipedia usernames can be as anonymous — or as personally-identifying — as you like, we strongly
                    advise you to encourage your students to choose anonymous usernames. As the instructor, you'll still be
                    able to see their real names alongside their usernames on the Dashboard.

                    Please remember to send this enrollment link to students
                    right away so they can register on the Dashboard:
