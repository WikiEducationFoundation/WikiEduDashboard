                The Wiki Education Foundation is conducting a research project about the types of skills students learn from Wikipedia-based assignments, and we're asking for your help.

                When you take our brief online survey at the start and end of your
                assignment, weâ€™ll provide you with personal feedback for you to
                compare what you know now with what you'll know then. Nobody
                else will see your personal info. Your instructor won't see the
                survey, and it will not be part of your grade.

                Student participants in the research will be entered into a
                drawing for a $50 USD Amazon Gift card. Four $50 USD Amazon gift
                cards will be given out randomly for every 100 participants in
                the research study. To enter, you must complete both the pre and
                post course assessments, available on the Wiki Ed Dashboard.
                You may gain an additional entry to win (increasing your odds)
                by completing the additional qualitative post-course survey that
                will be made available after completion of your Wikipedia
                assignment. No more than one gift card will be awarded per
                student entrant. Drawing will take place on January 17th, 2017.
