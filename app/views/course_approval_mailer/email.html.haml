                  As we previously discussed, your students will keep their work in sandboxes this term.
                  We've adjusted your course page accordingly. Please remind students that they will not
                  be moving their work into the article main space. For more information about how this
                  will affect your course,

                  To get started with your Wikipedia assignment, please distribute the
                  following enrollment link to your students:
                %p.paragraph
                  %a.link{href: @enroll_link}= @enroll_link
                %p.paragraph
                  This link will enable your students to both create a Wikipedia account
                  and then enroll on your Dashboard course page. Once a student is
                  enrolled, you'll be able to use the Dashboard to track their progress
                  throughout the Wikipedia assignment. They should create their Wikipedia
                  accounts outside of class, as Wikipedia has a limit of 6 new accounts
                  per day from a single IP address.
                %p.paragraph
                  When you distribute the enrollment link, we strongly encourage you to
                  %strong advise your students to choose anonymous Wikipedia usernames.
                  As their instructor, you will be able to see their real names on the Dashboard.
                %p.paragraph
                  The best way to familiarize yourself with the Wikipedia assignment is to
                  go through it along with your students. We strongly urge you to go through
                  the activities and exercises outlined on your course timeline to become
                  more acquainted with Wikipedia editing and the Dashboard.
                %p.paragraph
                  Please get your students onto the Dashboard early on so that students can
                  familiarize themselves with the Wikipedia assignment.
                %p.paragraph
                  In addition to myself, you'll be working with one of our Wikipedia Experts.
                  You can reach out to either of us using the "Get Help" button on your course
                  page.
