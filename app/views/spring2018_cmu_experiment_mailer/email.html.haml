                As part of a research collaboration with Wiki Education, we are
                enriching the Dashboard training modules with a new discussion
                service, in which students from classes across North America
                participate in small-group video sessions, to support each other
                as they learn how to improve Wikipedia articles. Our pilot last
                term suggests that students benefit from these sessions, as they
                not only mastered Wikipedia techniques, but also gained
                important critical thinking and civil scholarship skills.
              %p.paragraph
                We will host three support sessions at appropriate times during the term:
              %ol.paragraph
                %li Getting started editing Wikipedia pages (e.g., creating a personal user page)
                %li Understanding Wikipedia policies (e.g., reliable sources and neutral point of view)
                %li Peer-reviewing studentsâ€™ articles
              %p.paragraph
                Do you want to offer these discussions sessions to students in your class?

                No additional work is needed from you, but it would be
                great if you can encourage your students to participate by
                announcing this in your class and providing extra credit to
                students who participate. You can read more about the service

                Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
