                Just a quick reminder that you still need to hit "submit"
                on your Wiki Education

              %p.paragraph
                After you hit submit, we'll review your Wikipedia assignment 
                and make it live on our system. Your students cannot begin their 
                Wikipedia projects until you've submitted your page for review.

                Don't worry, you can continue making changes to your course page after it's approved.
