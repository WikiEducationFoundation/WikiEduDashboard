                I hope your term is going well. Our student training modules provide
                students with critical information as they learn how to contribute
                to Wikipedia. I noticed that some of your students are not up-to-date
                with the student training modules as outlined on your course timeline.
              %p.paragraph
                The trainings can be easy to overlook, but they truly help your
                students as they navigate Wikipedia. The students who have overdue
                training modules will have received a reminder by email. You can also
                post a reminder to each of their Wikipedia talk pages if you wish; to do so,
                click the button with the 'comment' icon from the Students tab of your
                Dashboard course page.

                Of course, if your schedule has changed, just let us know and update it on your course page.

                Looking forward to seeing all the great contributions your students make this term.
