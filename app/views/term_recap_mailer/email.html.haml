                Thank you for participating in the Wikipedia Student Program during
                #{link_to @campaign.title, "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/campaigns/#{@campaign.slug}", class: 'link'}!
                You and your students were part of a cohort of #{@campaign.courses.count} courses whose #{@campaign.students.count} students
                contributed roughly #{number_to_human @presenter.word_count, delimiter: ','} words to Wikipedia. This is an incredible feat, and we couldn't have done it without you!
              %p.paragraph
                Here's a snapshot of what your students did during the term:
              
                %ul
                  %li.paragraph Added #{number_to_human @course.word_count, delimiter: ','} words to Wikipedia
                  %li.paragraph
                    %a.link{href: "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/courses/#{@course.slug}/articles/edited"} Edited #{number_to_human @course.article_count} articles
                  - if @course.new_article_count.positive?
                    %li.paragraph Created #{number_to_human @course.new_article_count} new entries
                  - if @course.references_count.positive?
                    %li.paragraph Added #{number_to_human @course.references_count, delimiter: ','} references
                  %li.paragraph Received about #{number_to_human @course.view_sum, delimiter: ','} page views

              %p.paragraph
                Numbers only tell part of the story. I encourage you to share your
                %a.link{href: "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/courses/#{@course.slug}"} course page
                to let others know how your students impacted Wikipedia and how Wikipedia impacted your students!
