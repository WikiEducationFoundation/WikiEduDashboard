# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    wp10: Structural Completeness
    wp10_doc: >
      The 'Structural Completeness' score represents how closely an article fits
      the mold of a mature Wikipedia article, based on the machine learning-based
      Objective Revision Evaluation Service (https://ores.wikimedia.org/). These
      scores are calculated based on the size of an article, the number of
      references and wikilinks, and other basic text features. A high score
      usually indicates that an article follow Wikipedia's conventions for the
      structure of a good article, but it does not take into account the content
      itself. (These scores are only available for English Wikipedia articles.)

        not significantly customize your timeline previously, we recommend
        starting a new course so that you'll have the most up-to-date

          For an Article Scoped Program, the Dashboard will only track edits to the articles that you have configured it for. After your page has been created, you can add individual articles to track assigning articles to individual editors or by adding them as Available Articles. For larger sets of articles, you can use any of these tools to define articles you want to track.

          Select any scoping methods you want to configure now. You can also add scoping methods later from the Articles tab.
        categories: Categories
        categories_short_desc: The Category feature on a wiki is used to collect related articles. You can use the name of the Category to tell the Dashboard to track all the articles in that Category.
        categories_desc: >
          Tracking a Category means that the Dashboard will count edits to any articles in that Category. By default (depth 0), only the articles that are directly in that Category will be tracked.

          You can increase the depth value (up to a maximum of 3) if you want to include articles that are in sub-categories of that Category. Be sure to browse the Category first, to make sure the sub-Categories match what you intend to track.
        templates: Templates
        templates_short_desc: You can track articles based on a Template that they contain, which works whether the Template is used on article itself, or on the corresponding Talk page — such as WikiProject templates.
        petscan: PetScan
        petscan_short_desc: PetScan is a tool that allows you to query wiki pages based on a wide range of criteria — including categories, templates, wikilinks, and much more. You can use a PetScan query ID to configure a set of articles to track on the Dashboard.
        pagepile: PagePile
        pagepile_short_desc: PagePile is a tool that allows you to create a list of pages which doesn't change over time and is identified by a unique ID.
        templates_desc: >
          Templates are used for a wide variety of purposes on wiki pages, but some are specific to a topic. Navigation templates, WikiProject templates, and topic-specific Infobox templates are particularly useful when using a Template to configure an Article Scoped Program.
        pagepile_desc: >
          PagePile is a tool on Wikimedia Cloud. It allows users to collect and organize a group of wiki pages into a single bundle called a "pile." These piles can then be easily shared with others, enabling collaborative work and information sharing.

          In contrast to PetScan, the articles in a pile will not change over time, even when categories, templates or other data used to create that set of articles have changed.
        petscan_desc: >
          PetScan is a powerful but complex tool for querying a set of wiki pages based on a wide variety of criteria and data sources. You can use PetScan directly to create the query for a set of articles you want to track, which gives you access to the full set of options to target your query very precisely. Alternatively, you can create a PetScan query from some of the most common options directly from the Dashboard.

          PetScan saves the query parameters and provides an ID for that query. The results of that query may change over time, for example when new articles are added to category that the query includes. The Dashboard will periodically refresh the query results for a given ID, and will update its statistics based on the latest set of articles that PetScan produces.
        petscan_create_psid: Create a PetScan ID using the official PetScan tool
        pagepile_create_id: Create a PagePile using the official PagePile tool

      These reports are not 100% accurate. For example, a direct quote with proper attribution
      may trigger a false positive plagiarism report. Please review the student's contributions
      and the details of the report before taking any action. (If you find that the change — or

  suggestions:
    editing: Editing Suggestions
    suggestion_docs:
      fa: No further content additions should be necessary unless new information becomes available; further improvements to the prose quality are often possible.
      a: Expert knowledge may be needed to tweak the article, and style problems may need solving. Peer review may help.
      ga: Some editing by subject and style experts is helpful; comparison with an existing featured article on a similar topic may highlight areas where content is weak or missing.
      bplus: May be improved by input from experts to assess where coverage is still missing, and also by illustrations, historical background, and further references. Consider peer review or nominating for good article status. If the article is not already fully wikified, now is the time.
      b: A few aspects of content and style need to be addressed. Expert knowledge may be needed. The inclusion of supporting materials should be considered if practical, and the article checked for general compliance with the Manual of Style and related style guidelines.
      c: Considerable editing is needed to close gaps in content and solve cleanup problems.
      start: Providing references to reliable sources should come first; the article also needs substantial improvement in content and organisation. Also improve the grammar, spelling, writing style and improve the jargon use.
      stub: Any editing or additional material can be helpful. The provision of meaningful content should be a priority. The best solution for a Stub-class Article to step up to a Start-class Article is to add in referenced reasons of why the topic is significant.
      fl: No further content additions should be necessary unless new information becomes available.
      list: Lists should be lists of live links to Wikipedia articles, appropriately named and organized.
      future: Material added might be speculation and should be carefully sourced.
      disambig: Additions should be made as new articles of that name are created. Pay close attention to the proper naming of such pages, as they often do not need "(disambiguation)" appended to the title.
      ?: Suggestions not available - The article is either not rated or suggestions not available for the rating.
      does_not_exist: This article does not exist on Wikipedia.
