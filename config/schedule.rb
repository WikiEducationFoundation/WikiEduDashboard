# Use this file to easily define all of your cron jobs.

# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
# set :output, '/path/to/my/cron_log.log'
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command '/usr/bin/some_great_command'
#   runner 'MyModel.some_method'
#   rake 'some:great:rake:task'
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner 'AnotherModel.prune_old_records'

# Course updates will pull in revisions and articles for courses that are ongoing
# or still within the update window. They are sorted into queues depending on how
# long they run, with short courses having their own queue and very long ones their
# own as well.
every 5.minutes do
  rake 'batch:schedule_course_updates'
end

# Constant updates are independent of the main course stats, pulling in revision
# metadata, generating alerts, and doing other data and network-intensive tasks,
# for all current courses.
every 4.minutes do
  rake 'batch:update_constantly'
end

# This pulls in additional data and performs other tasks that do not need to be
# done many times per day.
every 1.day, at: '4:30 am' do
  rake 'batch:update_daily'
end

every 1.day, at: '4:35 am' do
  rake 'batch:update_views'
end

every [:monday, :tuesday, :wednesday, :thursday], at: '10:15 am' do
  rake 'batch:survey_update'
end

every [:monday, :tuesday, :wednesday, :thursday], at: '10:30 am' do
