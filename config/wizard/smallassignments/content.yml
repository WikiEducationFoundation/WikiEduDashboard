            Welcome to your Wikipedia project's course timeline. This page will
            guide you through the Wikipedia project for your course. Be sure to
            check with your instructor to see if there are other pages you should
            be following as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your course has also been assigned a Wikipedia Content Expert. Check
            your Talk page for notes from them. You can also reach them through
            the "<strong>Get Help</strong>" button on this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, please review the following handouts:

              It's time to dive into Wikipedia. Below, you'll find the first set
              of online trainings you'll need to take. New modules will appear
              on this timeline as you get to new milestones. Be sure to check
              back and complete them! Incomplete trainings will be reflected in
              your grade.

        content: |
          <p>
            It's time to think critically about Wikipedia articles. You'll evaluate
            a Wikipedia article related to the course and leave suggestions for
            improving it on the article's Talk page.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete the "Evaluating Articles and Sources" training (linked below).</li>
            <li>
              Create a section in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox">your sandbox</a>
              titled "Article evaluation" where you'll leave notes about your observations and learnings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose an article on Wikipedia related to your course to read and evaluate.
              As you read, consider the following questions (but don't feel limited to these):
              <ul>
                <li>Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything that distracted you?</li>
                <li>Is the article neutral? Are there any claims, or frames, that appear heavily biased toward a particular position?</li>
                <li>Are there viewpoints that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?</li>
                <li>Check a few citations. Do the links work? Does the source support the claims in the article?</li>
                <li>
                  Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?
                  Where does the information come from? Are these neutral sources?
                  If biased, is that bias noted?
                </li>
                <li>Is any information out of date? Is anything missing that could be added?</li>
                <li>
                  Check out the Talk page of the article. What kinds of conversations,
                  if any, are going on behind the scenes about how to represent this topic?
                </li>
                <li>How is the article rated? Is it a part of any WikiProjects?</li>
                <li>How does the way Wikipedia discusses this topic differ from the way we've talked about it in class?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Optional: Choose at least 1 question relevant to the article you're evaluating
               and leave your evaluation on the article's Talk page. Be sure to sign
              your feedback with four tildes — <code>~~~~</code>.
            </li>

          <p>Familiarize yourself with editing Wikipedia by adding a citation to an article. There are two ways you can do this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add 1-2 sentences to a course-related article, and cite that statement to a reliable source, as you learned in the online training.</li>
            <li>
              The <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/citationhunt/en">Citation Hunt</a>
              tool shows unreferenced statements from articles. First, evaluate
              whether the statement in question is true! An uncited statement
              could just be lacking a reference or it could be inaccurate or
              misleading. Reliable sources on the subject will help you choose
              whether to add it or correct the statement.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Before you start, review the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook,
              or see <a href="http://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> pages 10–11.
            </li>
            <li>When you've reviewed those pages, take the training linked below.</li>
            <li>
              When you're ready to start finding images, remember: <strong>Never</strong>
              grab images you find through an image search, or those found on
              Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit, Imgur, or even so-called "Free image" or
              "free stock photo" websites. Instead, you'll want to find images
              with clear proof that the creator has given permission to use their
              work. Many of these images can be found on
              <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Don't just upload an image to Wikipedia. Instead, upload it to
               Wikipedia's sister site for images, Wikimedia Commons. For
               instructions, read through the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook.

            Choose an article. Read through it, thinking about ways to improve
            the language, such as fixing grammatical mistakes. Then, make the
            appropriate changes. You don’t need to contribute new information to
            the article.
