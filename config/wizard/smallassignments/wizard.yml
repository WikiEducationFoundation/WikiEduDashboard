      blurb: Browse Wikipedia until you find an article that you would like to improve, and make some edits to improve the language or formatting.
      description: |
        In copyediting Wikipedia articles, students have a chance to engage other editors in conversation about their writing and improve the clarity of the language of the material. Students learn to write in different voices for different audiences. In learning about the specific voice on Wikipedia, they learn about the “authoritative” voice and how its tone can convince, even if the content is questionable.

  title: Working in groups
  description: |
    Wikipedia assignments work well as individual or group projects. When students
    work individually, they have the chance to make a substantial quality
    contribution to Wikipedia, but when they work in groups, they may have an
    easier time overcoming some of the first-time challenges of contributing to
    Wikipedia.

    If you decide to have your students work in groups for their Wikipedia assignment,
    your timeline will include some recommendations to ensure that each student
    gets credit for their work on Wikipedia.
