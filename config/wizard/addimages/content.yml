          <p>
            Welcome to your Wikipedia project's course timeline. This page will
            guide you through the Wikipedia project for your course. Be sure to
            check with your instructor to see if there are other pages you should
            be following as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your course has also been assigned a Wikipedia Expert. Check
            your Talk page for notes from them. You can also reach them through
            the "<strong>Get Help</strong>" button on this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, please review the following handouts:
          </p>

            <li><a href="https://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> pages 1–5</li>

              Create an account and join this course page, using the  enrollment
              link your instructor sent you. (To avoid hitting Wikipedia's account
              creation limits, this is best done outside of class. Only 6 new accounts
              may be created per day from the same IP address.)

              It's time to dive into Wikipedia. Below, you'll find the first set
              of online trainings you'll need to take. New modules will appear
              on this timeline as you get to new milestones. Be sure to check
              back and complete them! Incomplete trainings will be reflected in
              your grade.

          <p>You'll want to find or create an appropriate photo, illustration, or piece of video/audio to add to an article.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before you start, review the <a href="https://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook,
              or see <a href="https://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> pages 10–11.
            </li>
            <li>When you've reviewed those pages, take the training linked below.</li>
            <li>
              When you're ready to start finding images, remember: <strong>Never</strong>
              grab images you find through an image search, or those found on
              Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit, Imgur, or even so-called "Free image" or
              "free stock photo" websites. Instead, you'll want to find images
              with clear proof that the creator has given permission to use their
              work. Many of these images can be found on
              <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Don't just upload an image to Wikipedia. Instead, upload it to
               Wikipedia's sister site for images, Wikimedia Commons. For
               instructions, read through the <a href="https://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook.
