          * Move sandbox articles into main space.
            * If you are expanding an ***existing*** article, it's time to add your revised translation (including English sources, when available). Copy your edit into the article. If you are making many small edits, save after each edit before you make the next one. Do **NOT** paste over the entire existing article, or large sections of the existing article. Be sure to check the article's talk page and respond to suggestions from Wikipedians. Don't panic if your edits are removed or changed! Discuss it civilly on the article's talk page, and make a note of it for your report or presentation about your editing experience.
            * If you are creating a ***new*** article, *do **NOT** copy and paste* your text, or there will be no record of your work history. Follow instruction on the "Moving out of your sandbox" handout.
          * In your first edit to the article namespace, include a link of the source article (i.e., the article you translated) in the "edit summary" before hitting "save."
          * Copy the code ```{{Translated page|es|Page Title}}``` to the bottom of the Wikipedia article, replacing ```es``` with the language code of the language you a translating from and replacing ```Page Title``` with the title of the source page.
