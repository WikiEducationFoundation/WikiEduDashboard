        title: Introduction to the Wikipedia project
        kind: 0 # In class

          <p>
            Welcome to your Wikipedia project's course timeline. This page will
            guide you through the Wikipedia project for your course. Be sure to
            check with your instructor to see if there are other pages you should
            be following as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your course has also been assigned a Wikipedia Expert. Check
            your Talk page for notes from them. You can also reach them through
            the "<strong>Get Help</strong>" button on this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, please review the following handouts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> pages 1–5</li>
            <li><a href="https://wikiedu.org/evaluatingwikipedia">Evaluating Wikipedia</a></li>

                link your instructor sent you. (To avoid hitting Wikipedia's account
                creation limits, this is best done outside of class. Only 6 new accounts
                may be created per day from the same IP address.)

                It's time to dive into Wikipedia. Below, you'll find the first set
                of online trainings you'll need to take. New modules will appear
                on this timeline as you get to new milestones. Be sure to check
                back and complete them! Incomplete trainings will be reflected in
                your grade.
              </li>

                When you finish the trainings, practice by introducing yourself to
                a classmate on that classmate’s Talk page.
