  description: |
    To help your students familiarize themselves with the basics of Wikipedia editing
    and its policy and community norms, we've developed a series of online training modules. 

    Students should create user accounts and complete the core student training modules.
    This training helps students understand the Wikipedia fundamentals, walks students
    through their first edits, gives advice for picking articles and drafting revisions,
    and shows how to find support. Students who complete the training are better prepared
    to focus on your course's learning outcomes, and generally have better experiences.
    The training modules are embedded throughout your assignment and provide students with
    relevant help as they undertake different tasks of their Wikipedia assignment. 

    You can track which training modules your students have taken through your course
    Dashboard. **Grading students for completing the training is recommended.**

  title: Improving representation
  description: |
    Wikipedia should provide access to all knowledge – everything and everyone, everywhere.
    But just like the real world, Wikipedia can fall short, particularly when it comes to
    accurate, representative content of culturally diverse perspectives and histories. This
    not only includes gaps in article content but also in areas like the diversity of the
    authors cited, which means that students across all disciplines have the opportunity to
    improve equity on Wikipedia.
 
    To help your students understand the impact and challenges of working on articles
    related to historically underrepresented and misrepresented subjects and groups, or
    of enhancing representation in articles of any topic, we offer the training module
    “Improving Representation on Wikipedia.”

    This training explores why this kind of work is important, gives examples of how to
    identify representation gaps, and offers strategies for enhancing representation in
    an article’s text, references, images, and image captions.

  description: |
    In Fall 2024, Wiki Education is experimenting with having students directly improve the live versions of their assigned articles,
    rather than preparing complete drafts of their changes in sandboxes before moving live. This may simplify the project,
    encourage incremental changes and community interaction, and eliminate the error-prone step of copying student work from a
    sandbox into a live article. (Students creating new articles, rather than improving existing ones, will still prepare
    their initial drafts in a sandbox.)

    Choose 'Prepare drafts in sandboxes' if you would like to use sandbox drafts as you have in previous Wiki Education assignments. If you would like to
    try having students work incrementally on the live articles instead, choose 'Work live without sandbox drafts'.

  title: Working in groups
  description: |
    Wikipedia assignments work well as individual or group projects.
    In either case, students have a chance to make a substantial quality
    contribution to Wikipedia. Your decision to include collaboration should
    take into account the following factors:

    **When students work individually:**
 
      * They can independently control the way they navigate and participate on Wikipedia.
      * Students can experience every aspect of contributing to Wikipedia from choosing their
      topic to finding sources to updating their chosen entry.
      * You, the instructor, will have to assess a larger number of Wikipedia contributions.

    **When they work in groups:**
      * They may have an easier time overcoming some of the first-time challenges of contributing to Wikipedia.
      * Depending on how you structure your groups, students may only participate in one aspect of contributing to
      Wikipedia (e.g., one student might gather sources, while another writes up the contribution).
      * You will have fewer entries to assess.
    
    If you decide to have your students work in groups at any point of their Wikipedia assignment,
    your timeline will include some recommendations to ensure that each student gets credit for their work on Wikipedia.

    Note: if your course will have more than 50 students, we strongly recommend that you choose
    group work for your Wikipedia assignment.

  key: choosing_articles
  title: Choosing articles
  description: |
    Whether your students choose their own topics or you provide them with a pre-selected list,
    as the instructor, you should apply your own expertise to examining Wikipedia’s coverage of
    your field. You understand the broader intellectual context where individual topics fit in.
    Moreover, you have access to knowledge about published information on subjects and can
    teach students how to access these resources via library and online resources.

    When helping your students to choose articles, you also have a great opportunity to help
    address Wikipedia's equity gaps. Such practices include:

      * Directing students to consult and cite research published by scholars representing
      historically marginalized racial/ethnic, gendered, economic, and geographic cultural identities
      * Showcasing underdeveloped articles involving diverse knowledge and communities
      * Modeling antidiscrimination editing techniques that describe women in terms other
      than someone’s wife, mistress, mother, or daughter

    Regardless of your unique method of teaching students to choose articles, you can recognize
    and identify where Wikipedia falls short in your area of subject-matter expertise. Overall,
    you know what topics your students should be able to handle within the larger constraints
    of a typical term.

  key: tricky_topic_areas
  title: Medicine and other tricky topics
  description: |
    Writing about some topics on Wikipedia can be especially tricky — in particular, topics related to medicine, human health, and psychology. Is there any chance some of your students will work in these topic areas?

    If you expect any of your students to work on medicine-related articles — including psychology — you'll need to familiarize yourself, and those students, with the special sourcing rules for these subject areas. These rules also apply if your students will be adding information on, say, the sociological implications of disease or other ways of looking at medical articles.Even if your course is not directly related to medicine, these rules may be important if your students are choosing their own topics.

    #### Special considerations for medical and psychology topics

    Though it is not a medical resource, many people nonetheless turn to Wikipedia for medical information. Poor medical information on Wikipedia can have terrible consequences. For this reason, the standards for sourcing on medical topics differ from other topic areas. In particular, the use of primary sources is strongly discouraged.

    By Wikipedia's conventions for medical content, inappropriate primary sources include original medical research such as clinical studies, case reports, or animal studies, even if published in respected journals. In general, medical and health-related content should be based on review articles from reputable journals and other professional medical literature. Popular press is not considered a reliable source for medical topics.

    Topics that involve human psychology — in particular, clinical psychology or abnormal psychology — often overlap with medical topics on Wikipedia. In those cases, the same rules about acceptable sources apply.

    **Does your course fall into any of the following subject areas?** (If so, we'll include the training module that covers these special rules.)

    * Medicine/Health
    * Psychology
    * Life sciences
    * Social science fields, such as sociology and anthropology
    * Women's and gender studies
    * General composition
    * Other subjects that could involve human health

  title: Peer feedback
  description: |
    Collaboration is a critical element of contributing to Wikipedia.

    Some students will choose topics that naturally attract interested
    Wikipedians who will pitch in with ideas, copyedits, or even substantial
    contributions to the students’ articles. Some topics, however, may not
    attract much interest. Consider assigning students to review each others’
    articles soon after full-length drafts are posted, so they have time to act
    on that advice.

    Peer reviews are another chance for students to practice critical thinking.
    Since students are usually hesitant to criticize their classmates—and other
    Wikipedia editors may get annoyed with a stream of praise from students that
    glosses over an article's shortcomings—it's important to give examples of
    constructively critical feedback that focus on specific aspects for improvement.

  title: Supplementary assignments
  description: |
    By the time students have made improvements based on classmates' comments—and
    ideally suggestions from you as well—they should have produced nearly complete
    articles. Now is the chance to encourage them to wade a little deeper into
    Wikipedia and its norms and criteria to create great content.

    You’ll probably have discussed many of the core principles of Wikipedia—and
    related issues you want to focus on—but now that they’ve experienced first-hand
    how Wikipedia works, this is a good time to return to topics like neutrality,
    media fluency, and the impacts and limits of Wikipedia. Consider bringing in
    a guest speaker, having a panel discussion, or simply having an open discussion
    in class about what the students have done so far and why (or whether) it matters.

    In addition to the Wikipedia article writing itself, you may want to use a
    supplementary assignment. These assignments can reinforce and deepen your
    course's learning outcomes, and also help you to understand and evaluate the
    students' work and learning outcomes. Here are some of the effective
    supplementary assignments that instructors often use.

#   title: Wikipedia quality review processes
#   description: |
#     <br>

#     #### The *Did You Know* process

#     Did You Know (DYK) is a section on Wikipedia’s main page highlighting new content that has been added to Wikipedia in the last seven days. DYK can be a great opportunity to get students excited about their work. A typical DYK article will be viewed hundreds or thousands of times during its 6 hours in the spotlight.

#     The general criteria for DYK eligibility are that an article is larger than 1,500 characters of original, well-sourced content (about four paragraphs) and that it has been created or expanded (by a factor of 5x or more) within the last seven days. Students who meet this criteria may want to nominate their contributions for DYK.

#     The short window of eligibility, and the strict rules of the nomination process, can make it challenging to incorporate DYK into a classroom project. The DYK process should not be a required part of your assignment, as the DYK nomination process can be difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, it makes a great stretch goal when used selectively.

#     #### The *Good Article* process

#     Well-developed articles that have passed a Good Article (GA) review are a substantial achievement in their own right, and can also qualify for DYK. This peer review process involves checking a polished article against Wikipedia's GA criteria: articles must be well-written, verifiable and well-sourced with no original research, broad in coverage, neutral, stable, and appropriately illustrated (when possible). Practically speaking, a potential Good Article should look and sound like other well-developed Wikipedia articles, and it should provide a solid, well-balanced treatment of its subject.

#     The Good Article nominations process generally takes some time — between several days and several weeks, depending on the interest of reviewers and the size of the review backlog in the subject area — and should only be undertaken for articles that are already very well-developed. Typically, reviewers will identify further specific areas for improvement, and the article will be promoted to Good Article status if all the reviewers' concerns are addressed. Because of the uncertain timeline and the frequent need to make substantial changes to articles, Good Article nominations usually only make sense for articles that reach a mature state several weeks before the end of term, and those written by student editors who are already experienced, strong writers and who are willing to come back to address reviewer feedback (even after the term ends).
