  description: |
    To help your students familiarize themselves with the basics of Wikipedia editing
    and its policy and community norms, we've developed a series of online training modules. 

    Students should create user accounts and complete the core student training modules.
    This training helps students understand the Wikipedia fundamentals, walks students
    through their first edits, gives advice for picking articles and drafting revisions,
    and shows how to find support. Students who complete the training are better prepared
    to focus on your course's learning outcomes, and generally have better experiences.
    The training modules are embedded throughout your assignment and provide students with
    relevant help as they undertake different tasks of their Wikipedia assignment. 

    You can track which training modules your students have taken through your course
    Dashboard. **Grading students for completing the training is recommended.**

    #### Will you ask students to complete this training as part of their grade?

  key: generative_ai
  title: Generative AI and the Wikipedia assignment
  description: |
    Many of our training modules include guidance for students on how to thoughtfully and critically
    use generative AI tools to support their work on Wikipedia – **and only if permitted by your own
    course policies.**
    
    All students will be assigned to take the training module
    “[Using generative AI tools with Wikipedia](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/generative-ai),”
    which explains why AI-generated text is bad for Wikipedia and offers tips for using AI tools in
    limited and specific ways during the research phase of the Wikipedia assignment (again, if permitted
    by your course policies).

    Key highlights:
      * Students should not use generative AI output for _**any part**_ of their Wikipedia assignment. **This includes all exercises.**
      * The “No generative AI output” policy also includes text copyedited by AI tools like Grammarly. 
      * Student work on Wikipedia will be monitored by Pangram, an AI detector.

    All materials have been developed to create a more rewarding experience for you, your students, and
    the Wikipedia editing community. *Explore our [FAQ on Gen AI](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/faq/24).*

    We also offer a second, optional
    [training module about large language models (LLMS)](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/large-language-models)
    that provides more background information on how chatbots like ChatGPT work, and how they relate to Wikipedia.

  key: improving_representation
  title: Improving representation
  description: |
    Wikipedia should provide access to all knowledge – everything and everyone, everywhere.
    But just like the real world, Wikipedia can fall short, particularly when it comes to
    accurate, representative content of culturally diverse perspectives and histories. This
    not only includes gaps in article content but also in areas like the diversity of the
    authors cited, which means that students across all disciplines have the opportunity to
    improve equity on Wikipedia.
 
    To help instructors explore these themes with their students, we offer a **curriculum
    guide**, “[Improving Knowledge Equity with the Wikipedia Assignment](https://wikiedu.org/knowledge-equity-curriculum-guide/).”

    To help students understand the impact and challenges of working on articles
    related to historically underrepresented and misrepresented subjects and groups, or
    of enhancing representation in articles of any topic, we offer the **student training module**
    “Improving Representation on Wikipedia.”


    This training explores why this kind of work is important, gives examples of how to
    identify representation gaps, and offers strategies for enhancing representation in
    an article’s text, references, images, and image captions.

  key: sandboxes
  title: Starting in sandboxes
  # only_if: returning_instructor
  description: |
    For improving existing articles, we support two different strategies: have students prepare their initial improvements
    in a Wikipedia sandbox, or have students directly improve the live versions incrementally. Sandboxes will give you a
    chance to review student work before it reaches Wikipedia readers, but working live encourages incremental changes, provides
    more opportunity for community interaction, and eliminates the error-prone step of copying student work from a
    sandbox into a live article. Most instructors who have tried both strategies find that bypassing sandboxes and
    working live simplifies the project.
    
    Whether students use sandboxes or work on live articles for their main contributions
    Students creating new articles, rather than improving existing ones, will still prepare
    their initial drafts in a sandbox. They will also use sandboxes to prepare a bibliography and an outline of proposed changes
    before changing the live articles.

    Choose 'Prepare drafts in sandboxes' if you would like to use sandbox drafts. If you would like students to work incrementally on
    the live articles instead, choose 'Work live without sandbox drafts'.

  key: working_in_groups
  title: Working individually or in groups
  description: |
    Wikipedia assignments work well as individual or group projects. In either case,
    students have a chance to make a substantial quality contribution to Wikipedia.

    **Our recommendations:**

    If you’re teaching a class with 40 students or fewer, we recommend that they work individually.
    If you’re teaching a class with more than 40 students, we recommend they work in groups.


    **When students work individually, they can:**
 
      * independently control the way they navigate and participate on Wikipedia.
      * experience every aspect of contributing to Wikipedia, from choosing their
      topic and finding sources to updating their chosen entry.
      * work on the topics they personally care about most.
      * make a greater impact on Wikipedia.

    **When students work in groups:**
      * They may have an easier time overcoming some of the first-time challenges of contributing to Wikipedia.
      * They may focus on one aspect of contributing to Wikipedia (e.g., one student might gather sources, while another writes up the contribution).
      * They might find it easier to socialize and connect.
      * They’ll work on fewer articles overall which means you’ll have less content to assess.

  key: choosing_articles
  title: Choosing articles
  description: |
    Whether your students choose their own topics or you provide them with a pre-selected list,
    as the instructor, you should apply your own expertise to examining Wikipedia’s coverage of
    your field. You understand the broader intellectual context where individual topics fit in.
    Moreover, you have access to knowledge about published information on subjects and can
    teach students how to access these resources via library and online resources.

    When helping your students to choose articles, you also have a great opportunity to help
    address Wikipedia's equity gaps. Such practices include:

      * Directing students to consult and cite research published by scholars representing
      historically marginalized racial/ethnic, gendered, economic, and geographic cultural identities
      * Showcasing underdeveloped articles involving diverse knowledge and communities
      * Modeling antidiscrimination editing techniques that describe women in terms other
      than someone’s wife, mistress, mother, or daughter

    Regardless of your unique method of teaching students to choose articles, you can recognize
    and identify where Wikipedia falls short in your area of subject-matter expertise. Overall,
    you know what topics your students should be able to handle within the larger constraints
    of a typical term.

  key: tricky_topic_areas
  title: Medicine and other tricky topics
  description: |
    Writing about some topics on Wikipedia can be especially tricky — in particular, topics related to medicine, human health, and psychology. Is there any chance some of your students will work in these topic areas?

    If you expect any of your students to work on medicine-related articles — including psychology — you'll need to familiarize yourself, and those students, with the special sourcing rules for these subject areas. These rules also apply if your students will be adding information on, say, the sociological implications of disease or other ways of looking at medical articles.Even if your course is not directly related to medicine, these rules may be important if your students are choosing their own topics.

    #### Special considerations for medical and psychology topics

    Though it is not a medical resource, many people nonetheless turn to Wikipedia for medical information. Poor medical information on Wikipedia can have terrible consequences. For this reason, the standards for sourcing on medical topics differ from other topic areas. In particular, the use of primary sources is strongly discouraged.

    By Wikipedia's conventions for medical content, inappropriate primary sources include original medical research such as clinical studies, case reports, or animal studies, even if published in respected journals. In general, medical and health-related content should be based on review articles from reputable journals and other professional medical literature. Popular press is not considered a reliable source for medical topics.

    Topics that involve human psychology — in particular, clinical psychology or abnormal psychology — often overlap with medical topics on Wikipedia. In those cases, the same rules about acceptable sources apply.

    **Does your course fall into any of the following subject areas?** (If so, we'll include the training module that covers these special rules.)

    * Medicine/Health
    * Psychology
    * Life sciences
    * Social science fields, such as sociology and anthropology
    * Women's and gender studies
    * General composition
    * Other subjects that could involve human health

  title: Peer feedback
  description: |
    Collaboration is a critical element of contributing to Wikipedia.

    Some students will choose topics that naturally attract interested
    Wikipedians who will pitch in with ideas, copyedits, or even substantial
    contributions to the students’ articles. Some topics, however, may not
    attract much interest. Consider assigning students to review each others’
    articles soon after full-length drafts are posted, so they have time to act
    on that advice.

    Peer reviews are another chance for students to practice critical thinking.
    Since students are usually hesitant to criticize their classmates—and other
    Wikipedia editors may get annoyed with a stream of praise from students that
    glosses over an article's shortcomings—it's important to give examples of
    constructively critical feedback that focus on specific aspects for improvement.

#   title: Wikipedia quality review processes
#   description: |
#     <br>

#     #### The *Did You Know* process

#     Did You Know (DYK) is a section on Wikipedia’s main page highlighting new content that has been added to Wikipedia in the last seven days. DYK can be a great opportunity to get students excited about their work. A typical DYK article will be viewed hundreds or thousands of times during its 6 hours in the spotlight.

#     The general criteria for DYK eligibility are that an article is larger than 1,500 characters of original, well-sourced content (about four paragraphs) and that it has been created or expanded (by a factor of 5x or more) within the last seven days. Students who meet this criteria may want to nominate their contributions for DYK.

#     The short window of eligibility, and the strict rules of the nomination process, can make it challenging to incorporate DYK into a classroom project. The DYK process should not be a required part of your assignment, as the DYK nomination process can be difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, it makes a great stretch goal when used selectively.

#     #### The *Good Article* process

#     Well-developed articles that have passed a Good Article (GA) review are a substantial achievement in their own right, and can also qualify for DYK. This peer review process involves checking a polished article against Wikipedia's GA criteria: articles must be well-written, verifiable and well-sourced with no original research, broad in coverage, neutral, stable, and appropriately illustrated (when possible). Practically speaking, a potential Good Article should look and sound like other well-developed Wikipedia articles, and it should provide a solid, well-balanced treatment of its subject.

#     The Good Article nominations process generally takes some time — between several days and several weeks, depending on the interest of reviewers and the size of the review backlog in the subject area — and should only be undertaken for articles that are already very well-developed. Typically, reviewers will identify further specific areas for improvement, and the article will be promoted to Good Article status if all the reviewers' concerns are addressed. Because of the uncertain timeline and the frequent need to make substantial changes to articles, Good Article nominations usually only make sense for articles that reach a mature state several weeks before the end of term, and those written by student editors who are already experienced, strong writers and who are willing to come back to address reviewer feedback (even after the term ends).

  description: |
    Each term, Wiki Education runs a small mentorship program to match faculty new
    to the Wikipedia assignment with faculty experienced with the project. It’s a
    great opportunity for the program’s veteran faculty to share their expertise and
    guidance, and to build community among faculty teaching with Wikipedia.

    Our mentorship program is relatively informal; we ask that mentors meet with
    their mentees at least twice in the term. As space is limited, spots are not
    guaranteed.

    Are you interested in being matched with a mentor this term?
