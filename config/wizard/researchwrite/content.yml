          <p>
            Welcome to your Wikipedia project's course timeline. This page will
            guide you through the Wikipedia project for your course. Be sure to
            check with your instructor to see if there are other pages you should
            be following as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page breaks down writing a Wikipedia article into a series of
            steps, or milestones. These steps include online trainings to help
            you get started on Wikipedia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your course has also been assigned a Wikipedia Content Expert. Check
            your Talk page for notes from them. You can also reach them through
            the "<strong>Get Help</strong>" button on this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, please review the following handouts:

            It's time to think critically about Wikipedia articles. You'll evaluate
            a Wikipedia article related to the course and leave suggestions for
            improving it on the article's Talk page.
          </p>

              titled "Article evaluation" where you'll leave notes about your observations and learnings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose an article on Wikipedia related to your course to read and evaluate.
              As you read, consider the following questions (but don't feel limited to these):
              <ul>
                <li>Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything that distracted you?</li>
                <li>Is the article neutral? Are there any claims, or frames, that appear heavily biased toward a particular position?</li>
                <li>Are there viewpoints that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?</li>
                <li>Check a few citations. Do the links work? Does the source support the claims in the article?</li>
                <li>
                  Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?
                  Where does the information come from? Are these neutral sources?
                  If biased, is that bias noted?
                </li>
                <li>Is any information out of date? Is anything missing that could be added?</li>
                <li>
                  Check out the Talk page of the article. What kinds of conversations,
                  if any, are going on behind the scenes about how to represent this topic?
                </li>
                <li>How is the article rated? Is it a part of any WikiProjects?</li>
                <li>How does the way Wikipedia discusses this topic differ from the way we've talked about it in class?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Optional: Choose at least 1 question relevant to the article you're evaluating
               and leave your evaluation on the article's Talk page. Be sure to sign
              your feedback with four tildes — <code>~~~~</code>.

            Now that you're thinking about what makes a "good" Wikipedia article,
            consider some additional questions.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wikipedians often talk about "content gaps." What do you think a content gap is, and what are some possible ways to identify them?</li>
            <li>What are some reasons a content gap might arise? What are some ways to remedy them?</li>
            <li>Does it matter who writes Wikipedia?</li>
            <li>What does it mean to be "unbiased" on Wikipedia? How is that different, or similar, to your own definition of "bias"?</li>

          <p>Familiarize yourself with editing Wikipedia by adding a citation to an article. There are two ways you can do this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add 1-2 sentences to a course-related article, and cite that statement to a reliable source, as you learned in the online training.</li>

              The <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/citationhunt/en">Citation Hunt</a>

              could just be lacking a reference or it could be inaccurate or
              misleading. Reliable sources on the subject will help you choose

              Before you start, review the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook,

            <li>
              When you're ready to start finding images, remember: <strong>Never</strong>
              grab images you find through an image search, or those found on
              Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit, Imgur, or even so-called "Free image" or
              "free stock photo" websites. Instead, you'll want to find images
              with clear proof that the creator has given permission to use their
              work. Many of these images can be found on
              <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Don't just upload an image to Wikipedia. Instead, upload it to
               Wikipedia's sister site for images, Wikimedia Commons. For
               instructions, read through the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook.

            <li>
              Select one group member whose Sandbox space you'll all share to
              draft your article. Each person should link to that shared Sandbox
              from their own Sandbox page. A sandbox is like any other page on
              Wikipedia, and anyone can edit it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wikipedia doesn't allow multiple people to edit from different
              devices at the same time. If you're working together in person,
              one person should add the work to the Sandbox. If you are all
              working independently, make small edits and save often to avoid
              "editing conflicts" with classmates. Make sure that you're logged
              in under your own Wikipedia account while editing in your
              classmate's sandbox to ensure your edits are recorded.
            </li>

              Don't create a group account for your project. Group accounts are

          <p>
            Once you've made improvements to your article based on peer review
            feedback, it's time to move your work to Wikipedia proper - the "mainspace."
          </p>
          <p><strong>Editing an existing article?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>NEVER copy and paste your draft of an article over the entire article. Instead, edit small sections at a time.</li>
            <li>
              Copy your edits into the article. Make many small edits, saving
              each time, and leaving an edit summary. Never replace more than one
              to two sentences without saving!
            </li>
            <li>
              Be sure to copy text from your sandbox while the sandbox page is in
              'Edit' or 'Edit source' mode. This ensures that the formatting is
              transferred correctly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Creating a new article?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Read <a href="http://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> page 13, and follow those steps to move your article from your Sandbox to Mainspace.</li>
            <li>You can also review the <a href="../../../training/students/sandboxes">Sandboxes and Mainspace</a> online training.</li>
