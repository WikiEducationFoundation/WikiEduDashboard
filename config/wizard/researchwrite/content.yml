          * Evaluate an existing Wikipedia article related to the class, and leave suggestions for improving it on the article's talk page.
          * A few questions to consider (don't feel limited to these):
            * Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?
            * Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything that distracted you?
            * Is the article neutral? Are there any claims, or frames, that appear heavily biased toward a particular position?
            * Where does the information come from? Are these neutral sources? If biased, is that bias noted?
            * Are there viewpoints that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?
            * Check a few citations. Do the links work? Is there any close paraphrasing or plagiarism in the article?
            * Is any information out of date? Is anything missing that could be added?

Examples of media you can use are photos that you take yourself, images and text in the public domain, and works created by someone else who has given permission for their work to be used by others. For more information about which types of media can be uploaded to Wikipedia, see [Commons:Help desk](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Help_desk).
            * To add a media file to an article, you must first upload it to Wikimedia Commons. For instructions on how to upload files to Commons, refer to [***Illustrating Wikipedia***](http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia). This brochure will also provide you with detailed information about which files are acceptable to upload to Wikipedia and the value of contributing media to Wikipedia articles.

          * If you are starting a new article, write an outline of the topic in the form of a standard Wikipedia lead section of 3–4 paragraphs in your sandbox. Wikipedia articles use "summary style", in which the lead section provides a balanced summary of the entire body of the article, with the first sentence serving to define the topic and place it in context. The lead section should summarize, very briefly, each of the main aspects of the topic that will be covered in detail in the rest of the article. If you are improving an existing article, draft a new lead section reflecting your proposed changes, and post this along with a brief description of your plans on the article’s talk page. Make sure to check that page often to gather any feedback the community might provide.
          * Begin working with classmates and other editors to polish your lead section and fix any major issues.
          * Continue research in preparation for writing the body of the article.

            * If you are creating a new article, do NOT copy and paste your text, or there will be no record of your work history. Follow the instructions in the "Moving out of your sandbox" handout.
