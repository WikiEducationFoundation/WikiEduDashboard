##= Identifies articles that move to a different namespace during the course timeline.
# Specifically, it handles the following cases:
#
# 1- Articles that moved from a non-tracked namespace to a tracked namespace (usually mainspace).
#   These are identified when the article course record is created *after* some of its article
#   course timeslices.
#   This implies the article had revisions that didn't trigger article course record creation
#   (because it wasn't relevant yet). Later, the article course record was created â€”likely because
#   the article moved to a tracked namespace and became relevant.
#   In such cases, we need to flag the timeslices for reprocessing, since previous stats weren't
#   counted as tracked-namespace stats.
#
# 2- Articles that moved from a tracked namespace to a non-tracked namespace.
#
# Note: This class depends on the namespace attribute in the articles table. It does not update
# this attribute; it simply trusts its current value.
