#= Updates articles to reflect deletion and page moves on Wikipedia
# This class is responsible for two main things (we may separate it in the future).
# - Iterate over article course timeslices to sync articles. This updates title,
# namespace, deleted and mw_page_id fields.
# - Reset articles according to their new status:
#   * Articles that were deleted or untracked. These are articles that were either
#   deleted or moved to a namespace not traceable by the course. Such articles
#   should be excluded from course statistics.
#   * Articles that were restored or re-tracked: These are articles that were
#   either undeleted or moved to a namespace relevant to the course. Such articles
#   should be included in course statistics.
#   TODO: this class can probably be made simpler
