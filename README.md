The Wiki Ed Dashboard is a web application that supports Wikipedia education assignments, provides data and course management features for groups of Wikipedia users — instructors, students, and others — who are working on a common Wikipedia project. Users log in with their Wikipedia accounts (through OAuth) and allow the dashboard to make edits on their behalf. The dashboard automates many of the standard elements of organizing and participating in a Wikipedia classroom assignment.

This is a project of Wiki Education Foundation, developed in partnership with WINTR, intended for our education programs on English Wikipedia. To see it in action, visit [dashboard.wikiedu.org](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org).

## What it does

The Dashboard allows instructors to create a course page, which students can join. It then gathers information about edits those users have made and articles they have edited, and creates a dashboard for each course intended to let instructors and others quickly see key information about the work of student editors. It also creates a global dashboard to see information about many courses at once.

 * The system shows information for based on list course IDs defined by a page on Wikipedia.
 * The system uses a set of endpoints on Wikimedia Labs (see [WikiEduDashboardTools](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboardTools)) and the Wikipedia API to perform queries on a replica Wikipedia database, for information about articles and revisions related to the courses.
 * The system pulls page views (from [stats.grok.se](http://stats.grok.se)) for relevant articles on a daily basis.
 * The system pulls revision metadata from ores.wmflabs.org on a daily basis.

 (The system can also pull information from the EducationProgram extension's liststudents API to identify which users are part of courses. These are 'legacy' courses, and have limited support.)
