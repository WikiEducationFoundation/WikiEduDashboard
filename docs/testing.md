## Contributing

Testing is very important to the health of the Wiki Ed Dashboard as a whole. As part of a holistic testing strategy, the project utilizes the following testing stack:

* [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) for unit tests (model and controller specs, and specs for plain old Ruby object)
* [Poltegeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) for end-to-end integration testing.
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for testing front-end utilities and React.js components

The tests are run on Travis for continuous integration purposes. Upon a successful unit test run — excluding feature tests — on the `production` branch, Travis will deploy the `production` branch to the production environment.

Write tests for the applicable parts of your contribution wherever possible.

## Test setup
Integration tests require [qt5](https://www.qt.io/). On OSX you will need to uninstall qt4, install qt5, and add a symlink. [This wiki section](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit#video-playback-mp4-on-osx-requires-qt-5) is a useful reference.

If you are on a Linux environment, you can install test dependencies with `apt-get install pandoc`.

## Running tests

#### Server-side tests
Running `rspec` will run all model, controller, and integration tests (found in `spec/features`), as well as any other specs in the `spec` directory (such as classes in `lib` and `presenters`). Running `rspec spec/features` will run just the integration tests. You can pass any directory to `rspec` to run specs in just that directory, such as `rspec spec/models`.

#### Client-side tests
Running `npm test` will run the entire client-side test suite. During development, you can use `jest --watch` to run Jest in watch mode. This works similarly to guard, re-running relevant tests when whenever the corresponding files change.

### Server and client tests together
You can run the entire test suite, including a fresh compilation of assets, with `gulp build && rspec && npm test`.

## Test Coverage
All new code should be covered with appropriate tests. Much of the Javascript-dependent UI is covered by Poltergeist integration tests. Whenever possible, new Javascript functionality should be tested in isolation via Javascript tests instead (or additionally), as the integration tests tend to be both slower and more brittle.
