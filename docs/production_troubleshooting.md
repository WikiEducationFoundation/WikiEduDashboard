## Capistrano deployments

* `rails c -e production` from the `/current` deployment directory doesn't work.
  * Install binstubs: `bundle install --binstubs`.

* Capistrano cannot restart sidekiq processes because the deploying user lacks passwordless sudo.
  * Configure that user for passwordless sudo:
    * Edit `/etc/sudoers`
    * add `deploying_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` at the end


## WMFLABS database disk space

* Open a ticket to increase storage allocation, like this: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T324694
* Once allocated, drain the sidekiq queues, put up a maintenance message on the Dashboard, then extend the volume:
  * find the instance on horizon.wikimedia.org
  * detach the cinder volume
  * follow directions here to resize the Cinder volume: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Adding_Disk_Space_to_Cloud_VPS_instances#Cinder
  * reattach the Cinder volume. It should be /dev/sdb. If it's mounted somewhere else, restart the instance.
  * after resizing, restart all sidekiq services and remove the maintenance message

## Jobs rejected from redis queue by uniquejobs

Sometimes the redis entry for a job lock remains even though the job is not enqueued or running. Use `redis-cli` to interact with redis directly.

It's usually okay to delete all the locks by removing all uniquejobs keys. If there are no running jobs and the queues are empty, this is unlikely to cause problems. This will not interfere with scheduled jobs that haven't been enqueue yet.

* Useful commands:
  * Delete all uniquejobs keys: `redis-cli --raw keys "uniquejobs*" | xargs redis-cli del`
  * List all uniquejobs keys within redis-cli: `keys uniquejobs*`

## Database encoding errors related to unicode

Currently, mysql/mariadb use utf8mb4 by default and newly created databases will have columns that can handle 4-byte emoji characters. But the databases in production were created before this was the case, and have some columns that use utfmb3. For columns that are indexed, changing the encoding is complicated because the index size can change to become incompatible. For cases without any indexed columns that need conversion, an ALTER TABLE command will work. For example, to fix the `ticket_dispenser_messages` column in Wiki Education production in September 2024, we used this command:

* `ALTER TABLE ticket_dispenser_messages CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;`

(It ran very quickly on 20k rows.)

## Database slow queries monitoring

MariaDB has a feature to log all queries or all slow queries to provide for many different types of logging and analysis.
* Resources:
  * [official documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/slow-query-log-overview/)

* Basic commands to enable and use it:
  * Ssh the database server: `ssh peony-database.globaleducation.eqiad1.wikimedia.cloud`
  * Check current configuration file: `cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf`
  * Enable the feature by setting `slow_query_log=ON` on the configuration file.
  * Set the number of seconds that defines a slow query by setting `long_query_time` system variable. It uses a units of seconds. For example, `long_query_time=60` sets the slow query threshold to 1 minute.
  * Check the last slow queries logged: `sudo tail -300 /srv/mysql/peony-database-slow.log`.

Note: changes require a MariaDB server restart to take effect.
