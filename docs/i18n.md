### Internationalization

Translations for the Wiki Ed Dashboard interface are handled through [translatewiki.net](https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Wiki_Ed_Dashboard).

All new interface strings — excluding the program-specific content of the assignment
wizard and the training modules — should go into the `config/locale/en.yml` file,
and documentation for those strings (describing how they are used in the interface,
to aid translators) should go into the corresponding `qqq.yml` file. All other
locale files are updated periodically via translatewiki.net.

Within Ruby code, interface strings are inserted using the Rails i18n system,
with syntax within a view template like this: `t("courses.course_description")`.

Within frontend JavaScript (Coffeescript) code, the locale data is uses to generate
the `I18n.js` file, and strings can then be called like this: `I18n.t('users.mainspace_chars')`.
