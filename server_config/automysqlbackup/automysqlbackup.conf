# This is practically a moot point, since there is a fallback to the compression
# functions without multicore support in the case that the multicore versions aren't

# This option sends a START TRANSACTION SQL statement to the server before dumping data. It is useful only with
# transactional tables such as InnoDB, because then it dumps the consistent state of the database at the time
# when BEGIN was issued without blocking any applications.
#
# When using this option, you should keep in mind that only InnoDB tables are dumped in a consistent state. For
# example, any MyISAM or MEMORY tables dumped while using this option may still change state.
#
# While a --single-transaction dump is in process, to ensure a valid dump file (correct table contents and
# binary log coordinates), no other connection should use the following statements: ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE,
# DROP TABLE, RENAME TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE. A consistent read is not isolated from those statements, so use of
# them on a table to be dumped can cause the SELECT that is performed by mysqldump to retrieve the table
# contents to obtain incorrect contents or fail.
#CONFIG_mysql_dump_single_transaction='no'

# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_master-data
# --master-data[=value] 
# Use this option to dump a master replication server to produce a dump file that can be used to set up another
# server as a slave of the master. It causes the dump output to include a CHANGE MASTER TO statement that indicates
# the binary log coordinates (file name and position) of the dumped server. These are the master server coordinates
# from which the slave should start replicating after you load the dump file into the slave.
#
# If the option value is 2, the CHANGE MASTER TO statement is written as an SQL comment, and thus is informative only;
# it has no effect when the dump file is reloaded. If the option value is 1, the statement is not written as a comment
# and takes effect when the dump file is reloaded. If no option value is specified, the default value is 1.
#
# This option requires the RELOAD privilege and the binary log must be enabled. 
#
# The --master-data option automatically turns off --lock-tables. It also turns on --lock-all-tables, unless
# --single-transaction also is specified, in which case, a global read lock is acquired only for a short time at the
# beginning of the dump (see the description for --single-transaction). In all cases, any action on logs happens at
# the exact moment of the dump.
# ==================================================================================================================
# possible values are 1 and 2, which correspond with the values from mysqldump
# VARIABLE=    , i.e. no value, turns it off (default)
#
#CONFIG_mysql_dump_master_data=

# Included stored routines (procedures and functions) for the dumped databases in the output. Use of this option
# requires the SELECT privilege for the mysql.proc table. The output generated by using --routines contains
# CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION statements to re-create the routines. However, these statements do not
# include attributes such as the routine creation and modification timestamps. This means that when the routines
# are reloaded, they will be created with the timestamps equal to the reload time.
#
# If you require routines to be re-created with their original timestamp attributes, do not use --routines. Instead,
# dump and reload the contents of the mysql.proc table directly, using a MySQL account that has appropriate privileges
# for the mysql database. 
#
# This option was added in MySQL 5.0.13. Before that, stored routines are not dumped. Routine DEFINER values are not
# dumped until MySQL 5.0.20. This means that before 5.0.20, when routines are reloaded, they will be created with the
# definer set to the reloading user. If you require routines to be re-created with their original definer, dump and
# load the contents of the mysql.proc table directly as described earlier.

#CONFIG_mysql_dump_latest_clean_filenames='no'

# Create differential backups. Master backups are created weekly at #$CONFIG_do_weekly weekday. Between master backups,
# diff is used to create differential backups relative to the latest master backup. In the Manifest file, you find the
# following structure
# $filename 	md5sum	$md5sum	diff_id	$diff_id	rel_id	$rel_id
# where each field is separated by the tabular character '\t'. The entries with $ at the beginning mean the actual values,
# while the others are just for readability. The diff_id is the id of the differential or master backup which is also in
# the filename after the last _ and before the suffixes begin, i.e. .diff, .sql and extensions. It is used to relate
# differential backups to master backups. The master backups have 0 as $rel_id and are thereby identifiable. Differential
# backups have the id of the corresponding master backup as $rel_id.
#
# To ensure that master backups are kept long enough, the value of $CONFIG_rotation_daily is set to a minimum of 21 days.
